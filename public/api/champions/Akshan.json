The third cast is still usable during those effects.\nHeroic Swing's second and third cast can both be used while  silenced.\n Takedowns against  clones do not count for resetting Heroic Swing's cooldown.\nIf a  takedown is scored while Heroic Swing is active, the cooldown afterwards will be 0.5 seconds.\nAkshan will attempt to basic attack the target he fired at with the last shot after the third cast's dash ends, if there is no other input given.\nEach shot generates a stack of  Conqueror.\n Spell shield will only block a single shot.\nThe attack speed scaling on the damage of the attacks includes the bonus attack speed gained from Akshan's innate attack speed growth.\nAt level 18, each shot at minimum deals 108.36 (+ 18.06% AD) physical damage.\nDespite this ability not applying on-attack effects, it does apply  Navori Flickerblade's Transcendence.(bug)\nUnder certain circumstances, upon attaching the hook to terrain, Akshan will create a particle on the location permanently.(bug)\nThis particle can be attacked by minions.\nThis ability's damage is calculated based on the caster's current stats and changes dynamically.\nPENDING FOR TEST: Hook range including lollipop against walls, automated attacks range while swinging, final dash distance and speed.\nThe following table refers for interactions while the hook is attached or in flight:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nAutomatically initiates the second cast.\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Avengerang and  Going Rogue are disabled.
