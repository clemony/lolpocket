An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on  edge range - i.e. if any part of your  gameplay radius is within the hitbox, you are affected.\nThe third cast, as well as the Sweetspot for the first and second cast, function like ground-targeted abilities. An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on  center range - i.e. an enemy's center has to be within the hitbox to be affected.\nAs implied by the previous point, the Sweetspot for the first and second cast is implemented as separate areas of effect to the main component of the ability. Enemies must be within both areas to trigger the bonus damage,  knock up and  Deathbringer Stance's cooldown reduction.\nThe 'target gets hit' SFX plays whenever an enemy is within the Sweetspot - meaning it is possible to trigger the sound effect without affecting an enemy.\nIn the game, Sweetspot damage is incorrectly displayed as  a real critical strike.(bug)\nEach cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade and triggering  Force Pulse's passive.\nThe hitbox and Aatrox's model are fixed to the initial target direction.\nAatrox's facing-direction, for effects such as  Petrifying Gaze, is the direction he is moving, and not the direction the model is facing.\nAll damage modifiers  stack multiplicatively.\nThere's a small period of time in which Aatrox can't declare basic attacks after casting The Darkin Blade.(note)\nThis ability's damage is calculated based on the caster's current stats and changes dynamically.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Umbral Dash can be cast.

This discrepancy increases with higher attack damage.\nPENDING FOR TEST: It is also unknown whether this is just a Practice Tool bug.\nAttacks do not apply on-attack effects.\nThe attacks always count as  projectiles unless  Severum is being used. The lunar spotlight, however, may always be intercepted regardless of which weapon is in play as the main weapon.\nDue to this fact, non- Severum attacks will hit targets that are farther away from the center of the blast at a slightly longer delay.\n Spell shield will block Moonlight Vigil's initial detonation damage but does not prevent the attacks from locking-on.\nAll attacks from Moonlight Vigil  critically strike independently from each other.\nThis includes  Infernum's bolts, which also critically strike independently from the primary attack's damage.\nChanging weapons while Moonlight Vigil is in flight does not change the effect it has when it hits.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.\nMoonlight Vigil's effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides.\nWith  Severum, the extra flat heal is given only once, not per target. However, all damage done by Moonlight Vigil with it also heals him from Severum's  own passive effect.\nWith  Infernum, 14 fire bolts splash from each target hit (18 for  critical strikes). Bolts do not activate if Moonlight Vigil's initial damage kills the target.\nWith  Crescendum, 1 spectral chakram is generated for every target hit, meaning it is possible to generate up to 10 spectral chakrams with one cast of Moonlight Vigil if it hits 5 enemy champions.\nThe locked-on attacks' can be  dodged and  blocked, but won't be prevented if Aphelios is  blinded.\nPreventing the attack also prevents the additional effect (e.g. marking them with  Gravitum or granting  spectral chakrams).\nMoonlight Vigil has different visual effects changed accordingly to each weapon.

The entire effect is classified as a basic attack on a script-level, but is considered an ability for other effects (i.e  Sap Magic), which is likely due to a mistaken script-level tag.\nAlthough Ranger's Focus has no actual cooldown, 4 stacks of focus are needed before Ranger's Focus can be reactivated. The time before being able to reactivate Ranger's Focus is 6.08 : 1.6 (based on attack speed) seconds.\nEach arrow from a flurry applies  Frost and the bonus damage from  Frost Shot is calculated individually per arrow.\nSimilarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage,  Black Cleaver allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry.\nSources of flat damage reduction against any (physical) damage such as  Amumu's  Tantrum,  Leona's  Eclipse or  Fizz's  Nimble Fighter will apply the reduction to each arrow's damage, resulting in extremely reduced damaged compared to a normal attack.\nEach additional arrow from  Runaan's Hurricane will also split into 5 arrows.\nThe arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows.\nThe flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit, but no more than 3 targets per attack.\nThe flurry applies against structures.

Each comes with a missile that travels the same path and conveys the damage and knockback effect.\nThe furthest area (from 325 to 175 units behind Azir) is covered by a separate set of missiles with the same effects.\nAll of the soldiers and their missiles will end the charge prematurely when one encounters  Wind Wall /  Unbreakable /  Blade Whirl /  Rebuttal or upon colliding with terrain that they cannot charge through.\nThe charge starts at 0.25 seconds into the cast time.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.\nWhen the dash of the soldiers comes to a halt, all not-yet-affected enemies on top of the soldiers' landing locations (125 radius) are also knocked back.\nEmperor's Divide will not be canceled if Azir dies during the cast time.\nWhile the soldiers are charging forward, the wall is not impassable terrain.\nThis means enemies that are immune to  airborne effects can pass through the wall while its moving.\nThe wall will count as terrain for the purposes of 'into terrain' effects (e.g.  Condemn,  Dredge Line,  Heroic Charge).

In addition to being redirected, an intercepted projectile is also destroyed after hitting Braum (although this is only applicable to pass-through projectiles).\nUnbreakable's full damage reduction can block multiple instances of damage if they're dealt at the same time.\nMoving units do not count for being blocked by Unbreakable.\nChampion summoned units are not classified as units until they hit the ground (e.g.  Sapling Toss) and thus will interact with Unbreakable whilst en route.\nProjectiles whose effects trigger on collision will still trigger - dealing damage, applying debuffs, creating area of effects and marking the target as 'hit'.\nProjectiles that create an area of effect upon their collision will still affect other units and not only Braum.\nProjectiles that cannot hit Braum or his allies (such as an enemy  Prismatic Barrier) will not be intercepted.[2]\n Soraka's  Starcall's Rejuvenation projectile is however blocked.\nThe damage reduction will affect any source of damage whose origin is in front of the shield.

The bonus from Headshot is added after the critical strike is rolled.\nThe full damage of Headshot applies  life steal.\nHeadshot is a single instance of damage, thus does not trigger  Amumu's  Tantrum's or  Warden's Mail passives twice.\nThe basic attack triggering Headshot can  critically strike, but Headshot's damage remains unchanged if it does.\nSince Caitlyn's Art and Sustainability Update, Ability-granted Headshots are the same as the original Headshot override attack, though what lets them cast at high range is still relatively special. They trigger on-attack effects (including stacking Headshot).\nPENDING FOR TEST:  Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury, is special cased to search targets with the increased range as well.\nBecause Headshot stacks are generated on-attack,  Runaan's Hurricane bolts will not generate stacks towards Headshot.\nThe empowered attack will not trigger against wards.\nStacks will still be generated towards Headshot when attacking them.",

She can knockback and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nIf the target  attaches to a unit, they will only be displaced back inside once they detach. The Hextech Ultimatum does not end nor break the bind to the victim.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass allows him to cast it even if his target is outside the area, dashing through the borders and attaching despite being unable to escape.\n Yuumi's  You and Me! allows her to bypass the borders if the unit she attaches to leaves the area.\n Tristana's  Rocket Jump does not allow her to escape, but she applies the magic damage and  slow.\n Sett's  The Show Stopper does not allow him to pass through the borders and the dash will end prematurely when he encounters them.\nIf the target of  The Show Stopper is also the target of The Hextech Ultimatum, they can go through the borders while attached to him.\nIf Camille enters  resurrection during the initial cast, the  dash is stopped and the zone is formed immediately.\nThe Hextech Ultimatum ends if the target enters resurrection, but not if Camille does.\nThe Hextech Ultimatum ends immediately if the target is dragged by  Fear Beyond Death, or displaced outside of the zone by  Dragon's Rage or  Keeper's Verdict.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Camille is dashing.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll summoner spells are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",

          "notes": "Noxious Blast always uses quick cast, regardless of player settings.\nThe damage inflicted by Noxious Blast is calculated as follows: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer.\nFor example: with 0 bonus AP Noxious Blast inflicts 75 damages over 7 ticks of damage, so 75/7 (≈10.71) deals first of all 10 damage, then (2 × 75/7)  −  10 (≈11.43) deals in a second time 11 damages, then (3 × 75/7)  −  10  −  11 (≈11.14) deals in a third time 11 damages, and so on.\nThe damage displayed for Noxious Blast DOT (Damage_over_time) always remains constant and corresponds to the previously mentioned formula: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer. It's important not to confuse the consistent displayed damage with the actual damage, which is updated with each tick, see tick and updates.\nWith the same example as above, the damage displayed is always 10.\nOccasionally, Noxious Blast may not deal the displayed damage. This discrepancy occurs when the calculated damage falls between 0.5 and 1. In such cases, rounding to the nearest integer, specifically rounding up, creates a 1-point difference. It's important to note that the damage is rounded down to the nearest integer.\nFor example: with a  Blasting Wand's, Noxious Blast shows  so rounded to the nearest integer 116 magic damage, but really deals using the formula above 115 magic damage.\n(bug) When Cassiopeia has precisely 20 bonus AP or 40 bonus AP. In this scenario, Noxious Blast may inflict 1 less damage than intended. Importantly, this bug occurs independently of rounding considerations.\nPENDING FOR TEST: Enemies within the blast of Noxious Blast are  poisoned for something between 3.2 and 3.3 seconds.",

If the target is at the edge of the recast's radius, Elise will not appear at the exact offset behind her target but as close to them as possible instead.\nFor example, if the target's edge is barely within range for the recast, she will appear in front of them.\nIf Elise's location-targeted recast is used by issuing a movement command within the respective range of Rappel, she will descend as normal but then move to the location that the movement command was issued; her movement commands will not be interrupted from descending.\nThe delay for recasting without a target after Elise has lifted into the air is inconsistent.(bug)\nThe recast has a 0.33-seconds delay for issued movement commands, and a 0.5-second delay if the recast input itself is used.\nWhile Elise is lifting up into the air, she can buffer Rappel's recast by targeting an enemy with an attack command or the recast input itself in the meantime. She however cannot buffer Rappel's location-targeted recast.\nThe initial cast can also directly target an enemy to buffer the recast.\nElise will lift up into the air 0.05 seconds shorter in this case.\nThe bonuses granted for descending are not lost if Elise switches to Human Form.\nRappel can be cast on any targetable enemy unit ( champions,  minions,  monsters,  wards,  traps, and jungle plants) except structures.\nIf Elise is positioned within the radius of the unit she's using the initial target cast on, Rappel will instead register as a self-cast and not immediately descend. (bug)\nElise can Rappel to  Rift Herald from the other side of the  Baron Nashor's pit as well as to  Dragon by standing near the  Scryer's Bloom spawn locations. This is a result of  sight being granted in a smaller circle than the target range limit for descending and the  Summoner's Rift map having height variations.\nIf Elise enters  resurrection during Rappel, she will descend back down immediately.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Elise is in Rappel:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDescends onto the attack target.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDescends onto her current position.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll summoner spells are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",

The mark does not trigger and will remain on the target in this case.\nThe  magic resistance reduction debuff is applied independently of the  Charm debuff when the matured mark is expunged, meaning a target can still have their magic resistance reduced while they are resisting applications of CC debuffs (e.g.  Morgana's  Black Shield).\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but still go on  cooldown and pay its cost.(bug)\nAllure will restart its cooldown whenever the mark debuff is removed.(bug)",

If the storing keg is the initial detonation of the chain, it will add its damage to the explosions' damage as if it was triggered with Spellblade.\nIf the storing keg was attacked with a new instance of Spellblade, it will override the previously stored damage (if different).\nDamage can only be stored if Spellblade was consumed by Gangplank.\nThe stored damage is static and will not change if Gangplank's base attack damage or ability power (see below) changes.\nSpecific  Spellblade item interactions:\n Bloodsong: Dealing damage with kegs to champions won't apply Expose Weakness to them.\n Iceborn Gauntlet: The frost field will be created on the location of the keg that is attacked.\n Lich Bane: The magic damage will be added to the explosions' damage, but will be dealt as physical damage.\n Trinity Force: Attacking kegs grants the movespeed from Quicken; dealing damage with the explosion does not since it does not trigger  on-hit effects.\nBarrels triggering a chain reaction will show a lit fuse traveling toward other barrels.\nThe lit fuse is only visual and does not affect the time it takes for barrels to explode.\nPlaced barrels do not grant  vision until they explode, but they are revealed to Gangplank.\nIf Gangplank loses allied vision, for instance due to  nearsight, he will also lose vision on his barrels temporarily.\nBarrels prematurely grant  sight of their explosion radius (including across terrain and into bushes) if  Parrrley or a lit fuse is traveling towards them.\nThis area reveal happens even if  Parrrley is not going to make it explode.\nAn exploding Powder Keg will splash  Parrrley's bonus damage, and will also be modified if the attack  critically strikes.\nAttacks against Powder Kegs will apply on-hit effects (such as  Tiamat's Cleave), but  proc damage against the barrel itself is reduced to 0.\nDamage from on-hit effects will not increase the damage of the explosion.\n Spellblade is a special-cased exception.\n Dead Man's Plate's Crushing Blow will not trigger from Powder Kegs destroyed from Gangplank, even with  Parrrley.\nThe number of Powder Kegs in stock is visible under Gangplank's health bar for all players.\nGangplank stocks Powder Kegs even if the ability hasn't been learned yet.\nThis is due to the recharge rate at level 1 being set the same as level 0.\nWhile at maximum charges, ranking up the ability to rank 3 or 5 grants the remaining charge immediately regardless of the recharge timer.\nIf a barrel is destroyed during the 0.33 seconds-delay between explosions, Gangplank will plunder  gold and  Silver Serpents upon killing enemies as if he had done so using  Parrrley.(bug)\nThis effect persists through  death and will only end upon killing an enemy with  Parrrley.",

          "notes": "Graves takes 2.08 seconds to reload 2 shells (when the clip is empty) and 1.3 seconds to reload 1 shell. He must idle with 1 shell for 2.08 seconds before he starts reloading. These values can be improved with bonus attack speed.\nValues of bonus attack speed between 150% and 200% have a negative effect on Graves'  reload speed.(bug)[2]\nAttack speed growth will always have a positive effect on Graves'  reload speed and is not counted toward the 150% and 200% attack speed thresholds. For example, Graves gains 51% bonus attack speed from attack speed growth at level 18; meaning the thresholds at level 18 are at 201% and 251% respectively.\nMaximum reload speed is 0.651 : 0.891 (based on level), which equates to a reload timer of 1.54 : 1.12 (based on level) seconds, which is the shortest reload time at the 150% threshold.\nGraves can hit multiple individual enemies with a single shot from his basic attack. The first pellet hitting an enemy:\nDeals the highest damage out of all other pellets.\nApplies and triggers  on-hit effects.\n\"Single-use\" on-hit effects such as  Spellblade items will be applied to the very first enemy hit by a pellet (closest one in this case).\nApplies  basic damage, while all additional pellets deal  default damage.\nIs reduced by  Warden's Mail's Rock Solid.\nGraves' attack windup is based on such a low value that it will always take only 1 game tick, even at the lowest possible attack speed of 0.2.\nWhen Graves has his attack range increased by 35% to  573.75 via  Rapid Firecannon's Sharpshooter, it has special effects on the cone spread of his basic attack:\nThe reach of the individual missiles is also increased by 35% to  843.75 /  783.75.\nThe spread of the individual missiles is decreased by 35% (angle  ×  1/1.35) to 17.7° / 22.2°.\nPellets will not hit  wards nor jungle plants.\nWhen Graves performs a basic attack against these units, he will fire a standard ranged homing missile at the target to successfully hit it.\nThis same missile is also used for when his basic attack is empowered by an  Energized effect.\nPellets can be  dodged and  blocked, but not missed while Graves is  blinded.\nWhile Graves is  blinded, the pellets are special cased to fire in a random direction that is always away from the primary target of his basic attack.\nEnemies within range of the pellets in their randomly fired direction will be hit as the pellets cannot be missed.\nStructures can be hit by multiple pellets, as with other valid targets.\nIf Graves'  basic attack  critically strikes against an enemy behind their structure, and this structure is hit by all pellets, the damage dealt to the structure is increased by 33.3%.\nOn-attack effects such as  Help, Pix! and  Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury will be triggered as usual from the completion of Graves'  basic attack windup. They will obey their standard target-acquisition rules in spite of Graves'  special basic attack behavior.\n Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury can still fire its bolts at secondary targets even if they were already hit by the pellets of Graves'  basic attack.\n Black Cleaver's Carve will be applied for the physical damage dealt by each pellet, meaning that each of Graves'  basic attacks can apply up to 4 stacks of the effect, increased to the maximum of 5 with a  critical strike.\n Sundered Sky's Lightshield Strike will function normally with Graves'  basic attacks, causing the pellets to critically strike if the primary target was also a target of the item's effect.\nIf none of the pellets hit the target of Lightshield Strike's effect, however, the item's effect will not be consumed on the target thus not triggering the heal nor applying the on-target-cooldown, but still causing Graves'  basic attack to critically strike as if the effect was successfully consumed.\nHis basic attacks against the marked target will be guaranteed to critically strike until the item's effect has been consumed by at least one pellet hitting them.\nPellets will not consume the item's effect on secondary targets that are also targets of the item's effect; they will not consume the mark of enemies near the primary target that are marked by Lightshield Strike.\n Randuin's Omen's Resilience will reduce the critical damage dealt by every pellet, resulting in each pellet dealing less damage than if they were to not critically strike.\n Kraken Slayer's Bring It Down VFX for its missile appears to fire at the primary target, but will always collide with the target hit by the first pellet.\nThe in-game HUD for the champion's stat panel incorrectly displays Graves \"reload speed\" for reloading 2 shells as his attack speed, instead of displaying his actual attack speed which behaves normally like any other champion. This displayed value more accurately represents his reloads per second, and not attacks per second as the attack speed tooltip in the HUD would suggest.",

The Spirit's allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targeted effects. (bug)\nSpirits take 50% damage from turrets. (bug)\nSpirits cannot be  healed nor  shielded ( Summon Aery excluded (bug)).\nThe Spirit levels up when the Vessel does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e  mana), the Spirit's lifetime will increase instead. (bug)\nThe Spirit's destination is decided based on Illaoi's position and facing direction when the target is hit.\nThe Spirit is  untargetable while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.\nThe Spirit's lifetime is sometimes 0.25 seconds longer, while its untargetability is sometimes shorter, causing Tentacles to hit an inconsistent amount of times.\nRedirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the Spirit, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the Vessel.\nThis order of operations allows Test of Spirit to deal more or less percentage of the Vessel's health than would be expected:\nBecause the Spirit's modifiers can be different from the Vessel's, and the damage being pre-mitigated, allowing the Spirit to have higher or lower effective health, respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum achievable damage from killing it.\nBecause the cap is supposed to block excess damage over the Spirit's current health, which does not reliably do so or does too well, depending on whether the Spirit's damage modifier is higher than Test of Spirit's or not, respectively. This causes an increasing difference of damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between Spirit current health ÷ Spiritmod and Spirit current health ÷ Emod. (bug)\nTo fix this case, pre-mitigated damage would need to be capped at the amount that kills the Spirit, and only then have Test of Spirit's damage modifier apply.\nIllaoi needs 937.5 / 875 / 812.5 / 750 / 687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\n Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\nThe tendril can be blocked by  projectile-destroying effects (e.g.  Yasuo's  Wind Wall).\nIt will only be destroyed and not replicated against  Mel's  Rebuttal.\nThe application of the  slowing missile cannot be blocked by  projectile- destroying effects (e.g.  Yasuo's  Wind Wall).\nEffects that  destroy homing missiles (i.e certain  untargetabilities) will prevent the application of the  slowing missile.\nThe slowing missile will not be fired if the target is already  untargetable when the Spirit dies.\nThe spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by  crowd control immunity, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.(note)\nThe projectile tentacle model is linked to Illaoi's model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model. (bug)\nThe model will stop mid-air / vanish if Illaoi goes into  stasis,  sleep or  airborne, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.\nPENDING FOR TEST: The projectile is however seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nAnd will fire towards the same pointed location.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion before it goes into  resurrection via  Chronoshift or  Guardian Angel will spawn the Spirit with 0 health, making it  invulnerable. (bug)\nThe same does not happen with other resurrection effects (i.e  Karthus'  Death Defied) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.\nGrabbing the Spirit of  Viego will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear. (bug)\nPENDING FOR TEST: Grabbing the Spirit of an  Oathsworn will make the Spirit invisible. (bug)\nIllaoi is the only one able to see who's been Vesseled, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The Vessel will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.\nIf the target becomes a Vessel while  vanished, the layer on their model will fail to be added. (bug)\nThe Vessel status effect is a debuff that doesn't persist through death.\nIf the target is made a Vessel while  resurrecting, they will not revive as a Vessel.\nRunes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking. (note)\nTentacles damage with  First Strike only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  First Strike would deal 3 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 6 damage). (bug)\nTransferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Riftmaker,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage, and  The Darkin Scythe.\nRedirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of  Omnivamp.\nTransferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Torment,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\nAttacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one stack of  Black Cleaver to the Vessel. (note)\nWhen the tether is broken (whether the Spirit's lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the Spirit will  vanish and move to Illaoi's location.\nAn  uncancellable windup attack may still kill the Spirit after it vanished to grant the gold, but without making the target a Vessel.\nThe Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's  zombie state will remain active.\nIf the target that had its Spirit pulled from them is taken into the  Realm of Death, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a Vessel.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Illaoi is firing the projectile and while the target's Spirit is being pulled:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Tentacle Smash and  Leap of Faith are buffered.  Harsh Lesson is usable, but is buffered while pulling the Spirit.

If she acquired 100 ability power afterward, the next stack will grant 7%. The 2 stacks grant a total of 13% bonus attack speed and not 14%.\nArisen\n\nBasic attacks within  175 units will still use Kayle's melee basic attack animations and do not utilize  projectiles.\nThey are still classified as  ranged attacks.\nDue to this fact, projectile-blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while Kayle's target is within her \"melee\" range.\nAflame\n\nOn becoming Aflame, Kayle's bonus size grows linearly over 1 second.\nBasic attacks against structures and wards do not trigger fire waves.\nWhile at 4 stacks of  Zeal, the next attack on-attack reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by Aflame, releasing the first fire wave.\nTranscendent\n\nThe  Zeal and  Exalted buffs are replaced by a new buff that grants the benefits of both and it is not visible on Kayle's  HUD.\nThis buff also updates its attack speed value whenever a stat update happens and ability power is changed, however, it does not track ability power from other buffs, unless they have been specifically special cased. The following buffs are not special cased yet and will not grant bonus attack speed:\nRunes (including  Adaptive Force rune shards )\n Infernal Might\nFire Waves Details\n\nHitboxes shows by a graph side by side. A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.\nThe hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind Kayle, travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:\nRange:  850 (755 effective)\nWidth:  200\nProjectile Speed: 2800\nAngle: 18° (left and right at 9° to their side, respectively)\n Projectile-blocking effects can block each projectile individually.\nIt is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked \"invisible\" hitbox projectile.\nHitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.\nThe fire wave shares cast instance with the triggering basic attack.\nThe amount of  Conqueror stacks gained will be ( 2 /  1) if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.\nKeep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers  Bone Plating, the other's damage will be blocked.\nFire waves roll  critical strike chance on each target hit individually.\nThe distance of the fire waves scales with bonus attack range.\nA known issue is that despite dealing  area spell damage the fire wave does not:\nConsume Mana Charge from  Tear of the Goddess and its upgrades.\nTrigger  Manaflow Band.\nInteractions & Other\n\nBecause Kayle is both a  melee and  ranged champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to runes.\nHowever, keep in mind that, prior to ascending to Arisen,  Starfire Spellblade also changes this behaviour based on its usage.\nWaves are fired in the direction that Kayle is facing. Changing that during the attack windup via  Flash will also change the direction of the wave.\nEach ascension has an unique animation and a voice line. (See: Kayle's quotes)\nThe ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel Kayle's current action, nor her previous orders.",

          "notes": "Details\n\nThis ability has a cast time and cast delay. The former represents the amount of time Kayle needs to spend to cast and is equal to her attack windup time. The latter is the amount of time the portal needs to launch the sword, which is always 0.264 seconds seconds, starting from the beginning of the cast time.\nAs implied by the previous point, the portal is created at the start of the cast time and Kayle does not have to be alive for it to launch the sword.\nThe portal does not follow Kayle's movements, using  Flash or getting displaced won't change its position nor direction either.\nThe cast time can be calculated by dividing Kayle's windup percent value (0.193555) with her current total attack speed.\nRadiant Blast's cast time is 0.33 seconds at base attack speed, is at most 0.99 seconds at the minimum attack speed of  0.2, and is 0.066 seconds at the attack speed cap of  3.003. The cast time can be further decreased with effects that allows the player to bypass the attack speed cap.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that due to action only taking place on whole game ticks, the cast time can only be changed in fractions of 0.033 seconds. This also means that the lowest possible cast time is 0.033 seconds, requiring at least  5.8652 attack speed.\nEditor's note: Important to note that in patch V9.17, Radiant Blast's cast time was changed to be a flat 0.25 seconds, rather than scaling with the attack windup time. In patch V10.4, this was undocumentedly changed back. Whether the change to scale with windup time again was intentional or not is unknown.\nThe resistance reduction is applied after the damage has been dealt.\nThe expansion consists of 5 hitboxes, forming a cross-like shape centered 100 units ahead from the impact in its direction. Their technical details can be seen below and visualized on the image to the right. The left side shows projectile's width and the total area traveled if it does not hit a target, while the right side shows the explosions when it hits a target.\nExplosionCenter: 100 radius\nExplosionLeft: 150 distance, 125 width\nExplosionRight: 150 distance, 125 width\nExplosionBackward: 100 distance, 90 width\nExplosionForward: 400 distance, 90 width\nInteractions & Other\n\nThe visual effects of the explosion shows the blade and guard of Kayle's swords.\nThe resistance reduction can be tracked on the HUD as a debuff called  Sundered.\nEditor's note: Note that the  PsyOps skin still uses the old shred VFX, which also only shows for 3 seconds (effect duration is not affected). This is possibly an oversight as all existing, and at the time released Dragon Slayer, skins were updated properly in V11.18.",

Keep in mind that if a secondary target is outside of  Spirit's Refuge's zone, they won't block damage.\n Dodge: Dodging will always negate all damage.\nPENDING FOR TEST:: All parry interactions are marked for retesting because of patch V11.1 changes.\nInteractions & Other\n\nWhile the active's effect is up, a circle is visible to Kayle, indicating her  range, however, this circle only takes into account  Divine Ascent's effect on her range, not other sources such as  Rapid Firecannon.\nThe increased range (with the item's effect included) will be  675 prior to ascending to Transcendent, after which it's  725.\nTo clarify the description, Starfire Spellblade can behave both as a  ranged and  melee attack based on how far the target is prior to Kayle ascending to  Arisen, after which the attack will be always using ranged standards.\nIf the target is 200 units away or closer, the attack will be considered melee. This also uses her melee animations, not utilizing projectiles even after ascending.\nIf the target is over 200 units, the attack will be considered ranged.\nTo further expand on this: Using the ranged empowered attack will change Kayle's range type to ranged while the projectile is alive. This means that if the target could outrun the projectile, Kayle would be stuck on being ranged, although the bonuses from the active are not kept. While it's unlikely to be on this temporary ranged state for longer than half a seconds during a normal playthrough, it is possible to achieve few seconds when specific conditions are met.\nKeep in mind that while on-hit effects will be applied to all targets in the explosion, on-attack effects are only applied once per basic attack, not per target hit.\nSingle-use on-hits, such as  Spellblade, will be applied to the main target.\nIf the main target died prior to the projectile reaching them, or if it was a jungle plant, the effects will be applied to the closest target from the explosion's center.\n Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit can only be applied to the main target.\nDespite being one cast instance, Starfire Spellblade triggers  Muramana's Shock twice on each target, dealing normal bonus damage after the basic attack and increased bonus damage after the spell, totalling at ( 5.2% /  4.2%) maximum mana bonus physical damage.",

This means that if Kayle's and an ally's selection ranges are intercepting each other on the cursor's position, the cast will always occur on the ally.\nPrior to becoming Transcended via  Divine Ascent, casting Divine Judgment refreshes the duration of  Zeal  stacks at the start of the cast time to ensure that it does not expire while she can't attack during the cast.\nDuring cast, an indicator for the damaging area can be seen around the target, however, this is not visible if there is no  sight on the them.\nDivine Judgment can be cast on  clones too, including  Shapesplitter and  Warrior Trickster, which are normally not targetable for allies.\nWhile it's an uncommon occurence, it is possible to cast Divine Judgment on targets who just entered  resurrection or  zombie state. This is only possible with very strict timing and perhaps high latency.\nIt's recommended to avoid both of the afformentioned interactions, as they render the usage of Divine Judgment useless in many cases.\nInteractions & Other\n\nWhile the target is invulnerable, a number indicator will appear beneath them whenever they would receive damage to show the amount that was entirely mitigated. This is calculated pre-mitigation, meaning before resistances and reductions are taken into account.\n Rapid Firecannon's Energized effect behaves strangely with the set basic attack range:\nIf the ability is cast while the effect is ready, the range goes from  400 to  385 over 4 stat updates (400 -> 390 -> 387 -> 385). When the cast completes, the proper range needs 2 updates to set in ( 660 -  675 while Arisen;  710 -  725 while Transcended).\nGaining the effect during the cast will cause the range to cycle between  525 and  550 until the cast finishes, then the proper range is set after 1 update.\nSelling the item during the cast causes the range to be set to  250.\nPENDING FOR TEST: Range values are outdated because of patch V11.18 changes to Kayle.\n\nThe invulnerability can be tracked on the HUD via a buff called  Intervention.",

Kayn can transform by interacting with his portrait, and can wait 4 minutes until the other form becomes available, reduced by 5 seconds for each collected orb of their type after that.\n\nMelee orbs grant 2 points per hit and 6 points per takedown.\nRanged orbs grant 3 points per hit and 7 points per takedown.\nThe amount of points received per orb is multiplied by 3 : 10.39 (based on minutes).\nThe bar gets filled up completely at 500 points.\nIf the two forms are within 8% of each other, the last champion range type hit will determine the winner. If both types are hit at the same time, the trasformation will default to  Darkin.\nEach side's bar has a bucket system, starting at 60 points.\nEach time an orb is taken the system checks if there's an amount of points in the bucket equal to or higher than the amount received from the orb.If there is, Kayn is given an additional orb of the same type he received, while also subtracting that amount of points from the bucket.\nThe bucket fills by 0.8 points per second if out of champion combat for 70 seconds.\nDamage dealt by  damage over time effects and specifically  First Strike and  Summon Aery will not grant orbs.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Kayn is transforming:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll summoner spells are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A",

The in-game tooltip for the maximum single-target damage when all hits  critically strike is incorrect when this percentage is different from 100% and thus may calculate a larger or smaller number than what Alpha Strike actually deals.\nFor example, if this percentage is 75% then the tooltip would multiply the non-critical strike number by 100% + Alpha Strike's 75% bonus critical damage modifier = 175% total damage instead of the proper 100% + (Alpha Strike's 75% bonus critical damage modifier × (175-100)% bonus critical damage) = 156.25% total damage.\nAlpha Strike's primary damage applies after Master Yi reappears.\nAlpha Strike's  cooldown reduction applies on  structures.\nWhen Master Yi bounces from a unit it will grant  vision in a 600 radius around it for up-to 0.627 seconds after Alpha Strike ends, including across terrain, though not into  brushes.\nIt will always grant vision around the primary target, even if he doesn't bounce off it.\nAlpha Strike's damage is calculated at the moment that each mark is placed. Because of this, it is possible to inflict differing amounts of damage if Master Yi's AD changes between marks.\nMaster Yi will follow all his primary target's movements.\nAlpha Strike can only follow up-to 2000 units; If the target teleports a very long distance, it will not be followed.\nWhile vanished, the initial cast location of Alpha Strike counts as Master Yi's position, which is considered for effects such as  tethers.\nIf the primary target becomes  untargetable and there are no other nearby valid targets, Alpha Strike will end prematurely and will not deal the damage occurring after Master Yi's reappearance.\nThe choice of exit direction occurs through an indicator anchored to the target during the time that Master Yi is vanished. You are unable to choose the exit direction after the third mark.(bug) Selection commands (default: MB1/left click) and movement commands (default: MB2/right click) are both valid.\nMultiple commands can be issued, but only the final command before exiting will determine the direction.\nIf the primary target is a champion, Master Yi will be automatically ordered to basic attack them after Alpha Strike ends.\nMaster Yi will not be able to buffer other abilities.(bug)\nOnly the first instance of damage counts as a hit for effects such as  Conqueror,  Electrocute and  Eclipse's Ever Rising Moon.\nAlpha Strike does not interact with  Sejuani's  Permafrost,  Press the Attack or  Kraken Slayer's Bring It Down.(note)\n Spell shield will only block a single instance of damage.\nOn-hit damage applied by Alpha Strike will be negated by  dodge and  block, but not while Master Yi is  blinded.\nAlpha Strike's own damage will not be negated.\nIf Master Yi  dies during Alpha Strike and he is only focusing one target, the ability will only deal the reduced damage strikes and not the final tick of damage from reappearing.\nIf he is striking multiple targets the damage will be dealt immediately when dying, and if he dies before the bounce from the last target, Alpha Strike will deal reduced damage only to all units he already bounced from.(bug)\nIf Master Yi enters  resurrection during Alpha Strike and he is only focusing one target, the ability will deal the reduced damage strikes as normal and the final tick of damage after being resurrected.\nIf he is striking multiple targets, Alpha Strike will sometimes deal the reduced damage from repeated bounces and the main damage after being resurrected, and sometimes only the reduced damage, unrelated to the number of targets available.(bug)\nThe following table refers for interactions while Master Yi is performing Alpha Strike:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Wuju Style and  Highlander are usable.

The replicated missile acquires the original missile source as the target.\nIf the original missile was fired by a unit or auto-targeted effect, the replicated missile will be fired as a homing missile with the target being the original missile source.\nHealing projectiles, such as  Soraka's  Rejuvenation and  Sona's  Aria of Perseverance, will instead target Mel.\nIf the original missile was fired via any other targeting paradigm, the replicated missile will by default fire in the direction of the original missile source at the time of replication. This includes vector-targeted projectiles (currently only  Viktor's  Hextech Ray), for which the origin will always be Mel's center (since she cannot control the cast point).\nThe replicated missile will mimic all of the functions of and copy the behavior of the original missile, unless otherwise stated. This includes every aspect and effect of the missile conforming to the attack or spell from which the missile originated.\nThe scaling of the effects of the copied missile is calculated using the original missile source's attributes (namely their stats). The damage of the missile only benefits from Mel's damage modifiers and magic penetration, and not the original source's.\nThe following missiles are destroyed, but not replicated:\n Draven's  Whirling Death on its way back to him.\n Gnar's  Boomerang Throw on its way back to him.\n Illaoi's  Test of Spirit\n Sivir's  Boomerang Blade on its way back to her.\n Sylas'  Hijack\n Xayah's  Bladecaller and  Featherstorm\n Zac's  Stretching Strikes\n Azir's  Emperor's Divide Soldiers will end their charge prematurely upon colliding with Rebuttal.\n Syndra's  Spheres thrown with  Syndra's  Scatter the Weak will only stop upon colliding with Mel.\nMel may occasionally fail to attribute  Echoes of Helia's Soul Siphon's damage projectile to herself.(bug)\nThis can cause the enemy to be able to kill their own allies, and gain all the kill's rewards.",

          "notes": "Mordekaiser's Realm of Death. Champions outside of the death realm are seen as spirits. Blue spirits (above Mordekaiser) are allied champions while red spirits (below Mordekaiser) are enemy champions.\nAlly spirit\nEnemy spirit\nThe Realm of Death is a battlefield that exists outside of the normal realm in an alternate \"dimension\". It exists only for Mordekaiser and his target. It consists of an arena that has a radius of 1200 units and includes any terrain features that would exist in the map of the normal realm, including walls and  brushes.\nThe boundaries of the arena are impassable but not considered terrain themselves ( Unstoppable Onslaught exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.\n Dashes,  blinks,  displacements and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\nRealm of Death retains Mordekaiser's previous current health percentage when granting him a portion of the target's maximum health.\nRealm of Death will cancel and go on cooldown after its cast time if:\nThe target is  displacement immune,  crowd control immune or protected by a  spell shield.\nNote that all of the above plus any  cleanse effect are ineffective if they are applied after the target has been banished.\nThe target is a  clone or  Sion's  Glory in Death.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\nIf Mordekaiser or the target cast another Realm of Death, the affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\nThe previous circle will be overridden by the new one; it will be dispelled to enter the new circle.\n Spell shield will not block the initial  slow.\nThe reveal effect lasts for 1.25 seconds from the start of the cast time if the cast does not complete. Otherwise, the reveal ends as soon as the cast time completes.\nIf the target's  health is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health. Mordekaiser will still get the usual amount of maximum health.\nEntering or leaving the Death Realm will cause all targeted  projectiles to be  destroyed.\nThe transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt  channels.\n Grand Starfall will always be interrupted by the transition into the realm.\nRealm of Death will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter  resurrection after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a  zombie state.\nAny active  tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\nUpon entering the realm, Mordekaiser and the target are  cleansed from all  forced action effects\nThe cleanse will occur even if the source enters the realm.(bug)\nUnlike the other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\nMordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\nWhile Mordekaiser has hold of his enemy's stats, that champion's circular portrait will appear as a pip next to his health bar, visible to all players.\nRealm of Death's interactions with other elements/abilities (list is incomplete):\nMultiple Death Realms (possible through a  hijacked Realm of Death or if multiple Mordekaisers are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\nHex-gates on  Hextech Rift will not be present between realms.\n Brushes will maintain their presence between realms.\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass will cause him to detach immediately when Realm of Death ends.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\n Camille's  The Hextech Ultimatum, catching  Draven's  Spinning Axe,  Ekko's  Timewinder and  Parallel Convergence,  Malzahar's  Null Zone,  Maokai's  Twisted Advance,  Lulu's  Pix,  Pyke's  Death from Below,  Taliyah's  Worked Grounds,  Viktor's  Gravity Field,  Ziggs'  Satchel Charge, and  Rift Scuttler's  Speed Shrine are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions if the conditions are valid.\nEffects such as  Requiem,  Absolute Zero,  Grand Starfall and  Final Spark will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\n Akali's  Shuriken Flip can be recast even if the target is in another realm.\n Kindred's  Lamb's Respite is one of many area of effect abilities that will not take presence between realms.\n Malzahar's  Void Shift is special cased to not resist the slow but instead resist the dimension swap after the cast completes.\n Nocturne's  Paranoia only applies  nearsight to enemy champions in the same dimension as him.\n Orianna's  Ball will snap back to her the moment she switches realms.\n Sion's  Decimating Smash will stay in the realm Sion was in at the beginning of the  charge.\nThe target of  Devour will immediately leave  Tahm Kench's belly when he enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Taliyah's  Weaver's Wall is interrupted both for if she enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Urgot's  Fear Beyond Death cannot be recast while the target is in a different dimension than him. If the target is being reeled in however, then the execution at the end of the channel will take place regardless of the dimension either he or the target is in.\nThe fear upon a successful execution will occur in  Urgot's realm.\n Viego's  Mist Wraiths will spawn between realms.  Harrowed Path will also take presence between realms.\n Volibear's  Sky Splitter will only affect targets in the same realm as it was cast.\n Xayah's  Bladecaller cannot call  Feathers between dimensions.\n Yorick's  Maiden will take presence between realms.(note)\n Zed's  Shadows will take presence between realms.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Realm of Death.\nControllable pets and decoys can still be commanded between realms.\nJungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not take presence between realms.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",

          "notes": "Before disguising\nNeeko's disguise collection is offered through a special menu in the HUD. The menu holds up to 5 slots, based on the number of allied  champions. The player can select a disguise by  clicking on their portrait or via the Champion Specific Interaction hotkeys (default: Shift+F1:F5). The Sho'Ma disguise can be discarded by clicking on the 'x' next to the disguise's icon or via the sixth Champion Specific Interaction hotkey (default: Shift+F6).\nThe slot containing her Sho'Ma disguise will be third in the HUD if there are two or more allied champions in the game, otherwise it will be the rightmost slot. The remaining slots will contain allied champion disguises in order of their appearance in the pre-game Loading Screen.\nThe progress of gathering Sho'Ma from a unit will not be lost even if Neeko stores Sho'Ma from a different unit.\nInherent Glamour's cooldown only prevents Neeko from activating disguises; she can still store and remove Sho'Ma while the passive is on cooldown.\nNeeko cannot store Sho'Ma from  Dark Procession and  Powder Keg.\nStoring Sho'Ma from  Demacian Standard(bug) will require Neeko to begin storing Sho'Ma from another unit, then move into proximity of the flag.\nAfter successfully storing Sho'Ma, Neeko will celebrate by clapping.\nThis animation is forced and will override any other animation except  Pop Blossom's landing animation.\nIf Neeko attempts to activate a disguise while near the  trap,  ward, or jungle plant she stored Sho'Ma from, she will  leap to that unit's exact position over 1 second, though not through terrain, and then become disguised. If she does so for a monster and is near its respective jungle camp, she will leap to that monster's usual position in the camp.\nIf the monster is any  Krug, she will leap to the large Krug's position in the camp on the blue side or medium Krug's position on the red side.\nIf the monster is a lesser  Raptor, she will leap to its position at the time of storing Sho'Ma instead.(bug)\nThe leap is interrupted if Neeko attacks, moves, or casts certain abilities and spells.\nThe disguise will still activate after 1 second if the leap is interrupted by moving or attacking.\nNeeko cannot gather Sho'Ma while leaping.\nShe will fail to activate the disguise after the leap if she is affected by the same conditions that would break a disguise.\nInherent Glamour's leap has a number of interactions that set it apart from other  lunges:\nInherent Glamour's leap does not interact with  Voltaic Cyclosword's Galvanize passive;\nInherent Glamour's leap does not override the forced movement inflicted by  airborne effects;\nThe path of Inherent Glamour's leap will be similar to the path Neeko would take if ordered to move to the unit's position instead.\nNeeko will copy the unit's facing direction when disguising after leaping.\nIf Neeko does not arrive at the unit's position while leaping, she will continue moving toward it.\nAlthough  channeling will break Neeko's disguise, she can still disguise and leap while channeling.\nWhile disguised\nNeeko will copy aesthetics as well as superficial mechanical statistics. She will fake a number of readings:\nHealth bar (original's current amount becomes her apparent maximum)\nWhile disguised as a  lane minion, Neeko will take bonus physical damage from minions based on the disguise's form's health.\nShe will take damage based on her own health from all other sources.\nSecondary resource - e.g. mana, energy or none at all (original's current amount becomes her apparent maximum)\nIf disguised as a  Siege  Minion, Neeko cannot see her mana bar.(bug)\nStats\nBuffs and debuffs with their respective icons and VFX/SFX (there are exceptions)\nNeeko sees the buffs that are actually applied to her, while enemies see the disguise's form's buffs.\nThough Neeko can see the buffs, she cannot read their descriptions by hovering their icons.(bug)\nAfter gaining a charge of Shared Riches ( World Atlas,  Runic Compass), Neeko is unable to see the charge count until she consumes a charge.(bug)\nLevel\nKill feed icon\nA number of attributes she actually adopts are:\nBase movement speed if it is lower than Neeko's, capped at a minimum of 200.\nDisguising as  Elise while she is in  spider form will set Neeko's base movement speed to 315 instead.(bug)\nClassification of the unit (e.g.  melee,  siege minion; large, small monster; ward)\nNeeko is never considered a minion for the purposes of  Reinforced Armor.\nBase range type of the unit ( melee,  ranged)\nBase attack speed and attack ratio\nWhen disguising as a non-champion, Neeko will instead adopt their total attack speed, capped at a maximum of 2.0.\nBasic attack damage type\nFor example, many  pets deal ability damage instead of  basic damage with their basic attacks.\nHowever,  critical strikes from non-champions will always deal basic damage.\nThe  projectile or non-projectile quality of their attack\nWhen  striking critically as a non-champion with a projectile attack, the attack projectile is invisible and hits near-instantly, but can still be intercepted by  Wind Wall and similar abilities.\n Base attack range of the unit's base form\nFor example, in the case of  Gnar, she will adopt 175 attack range.\nSize (including size modifiers and base unit size) at the time of disguising\nVoice lines\nBase unit model, regardless of current form\nThe exception are Voidborn forms of  Blue Sentinel and  Red Brambleback, whose models Neeko does adopt\nDefault transformation toggle (non-innate)\nCharacter interactions (jokes, taunts, dances, laughs, toggle effects), as well as their  Recall animation\nNeeko can copy  Samira's taunt animation but she will not actually throw the coin via the  Taunt ability.\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, Neeko will play her laugh sound when attempting to laugh.\nEditor's note: This is an intentional feature, requested by fans when Neeko's V13.9 gameplay update was released.\nWhile disguised as a  Packmate, she will play  Naafiri's laugh instead.\nWhile disguised as a jungle plant or  trap, Neeko's facing direction visually appears to not change while moving.\nNeeko's real facing direction is, however, affected by movement for the purposes of direction-facing effects (e.g.  Petrifying Gaze,  Backstab).\nDisguising as a  monster will not cause Neeko's attack windup to be  uncancellable.\nWhile disguised as a unit not targetable by  turrets (e.g. wards, traps,  Kalista's  Sentinel), Neeko will not be targeted by turrets until she damages a champion.\nDisguising as a unit not targetable by turrets will not drop turret aggro.\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, Neeko cannot be affected by  Jhin's  Deadly Flourish and  Zilean's  Time Bomb.(bug)\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, Neeko cannot be tethered by  Taric's  Bastion. If she was tethered before changing, the tether will break as soon as she changes into a non-champion and Taric's spells can not be mimicked onto her. Once she changes into a champion the tether will automatically come back.\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, Neeko will break  Mountain Dragon Soul's shield.\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, enemy  Sundered Sky's Lightshield Strike indicator will not be displayed on Neeko, but she will still be affected by the empowered attack.\nAbilities and item actives with champion  targeting forgiveness (e.g.  K'Sante's  All Out,  Karma's  Inspire,  Kindred's  Mounting Dread) can be cast on Neeko even while she is disguised as a non-champion.(bug)\nWhile disguised, Neeko cannot be targeted by  Smite.(bug)\nWhile disguised as a monster, Neeko will not receive damage from  Unleashed Smite and  Primal Smite.(bug)\nWhile disguised as  Daisy, Neeko's basic attack damage will be attributed to  Ivern, allowing Neeko to attack turrets without breaking the disguise, as well as apply his  on-hit effects instead of her own.(bug)\nWhile disguised as a minion, Neeko will take bonus damage from other minions equal to the ratio of her minion disguise's current health, rather than her own current health.\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, Neeko cannot receive  Crest of Insight and  Crest of Cinders by killing  Blue Sentinel and  Red Brambleback, but can receive it once they are Voidborn.(bug)\nWhile disguised as  Lulu, Neeko will spawn a  Pix with the same skin ID as Neeko's.\nFor example,  Star Guardian Neeko (skin 10) will always produce a  Pool Party Pix with a Ruby Chroma (skin 10).\nWhile disguised as  Bel'Veth, Neeko's basic attacks always deal 0 damage.(bug)\nWhile disguised as  Elise's  Spiderlings or  Annie's  Tibbers, Neeko's basic attacks will only deal 100% bonus AD physical damage.(bug)\nIf Neeko has no bonus AD, she will deal no damage.\nHowever, Neeko's  critical strikes while disguised will deal 175% total AD physical damage as expected.\nWhile disguised as  Bel'Veth's  Void Remoras,  Zyra's  Thorn Spitters or  Vine Lashers, Neeko cannot issue a basic attack command.\nNeeko will benefit from  Mr. Kled's Wild Ride even while disguised as a  lane minion or  Voidmite.(bug)\nPENDING FOR TEST: is the same true for the clone?\nWhile disguised as a non-champion, Neeko cannot purchase  Runaan's Hurricane regardless of her current range type.(bug)\nNeeko cannot purchase  Elixir of Iron,  Elixir of Sorcery ,  Elixir of Wrath,  Farsight Alteration while disguised as a unit with a lower level than required.\nNeeko will fail to purchase these items when disguising as a unit of required level if her real level is lower than required.\nBreaking the disguise\nInherent Glamour's disguise is broken by the following actions:\nCasting  Blooming Burst or  Tangle-Barbs.\nCasting  Pop Blossom will not break the disguise immediately, but after a delay.\nUsing  Exhaust,  Ignite,  Smite,  Unleashed Smite,  Primal Smite, or  Mark.\nUsing  Dash will not break the disguise.\nUsing active item effects that deal Ability damage (e.g.  Hextech Rocketbelt,  Redemption, and  Tiamat), or apply  crowd control ( Randuin's Omen).\nWhile disguised as a champion(note), dealing ability damage with abilities or items will also break the disguise.\nDamage dealt by  Voidmites summoned by Neeko will be attributed to Neeko and will break the disguise if the disguise's form is a non-champion.(note)\nThis includes Voidmites summoned by Rift Herald Rodeo if Rift Herald was  attached to Neeko during the charge.",

Due to flat bonuses increasing the time threshold, it is possible for the ability's effects to end before reaching the total uncapped movement speed.\nThe bonus movement speed ignores the movement speed cap.\nIf Nunu turns continuously he will create a 600 unit circle, increased with bonus movement speed, striking the same point up to 3 times, for a maximum of 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 300% AP) magic damage. The damage can be further increased by detonating the snowball, for a total of 360 / 450 / 540 / 630 / 720 (+450% AP) magic damage.\n Ryze's  Realm Warp will only teleport Nunu and Willump, leaving the  snowball behind.\nHovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of Biggest Snowball Ever!.\nNunu gains a slightly larger field of view during Biggest Snowball Ever!.\n Projectile-interception effects will destroy the snowball only after it has been released.\nBiggest Snowball Ever! is disabled for the first 15 seconds of the game.\n Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the  stun.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Nunu & Willump are  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed, but cannot input movement commands.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects",

Internally, they are handled through an item modifier. An upgraded item gains the (Masterwork) descriptor next to its name in tooltips as well as a special Masterwork frame overlay on the item's icon itself, both indicating the application of Living Forge's modifier.\nStatistics' gold value for Masterwork item purposes is shown in the following table. The table also indicates all upgradeable stats.\n 31.25 per 1 point of ability haste.\n 20 per 1 point of ability power.\n 35 per 1 point of attack damage.\n 30 per 1% of attack speed.\n 20 per 1 point of armor.\n 18 per 1 point of magic resistance.\n1 point of health has a variable  gold value, based on the number of upgradeable stats that exist on the item:\nIf health is the item's only upgradeable stat, it receives +375 health and health is valued at  2.6 per point.\nIf the item has health and only one other upgradeable stat, it receives +185 health and health is valued at  2.702 per point.\nIf the item has health and two other upgradeable stats, it receives +125 health and health is valued at  2.6 per point.\nIf the item has health and three other upgradeable stats, it receives +90 health and health is valued at  2.7 per point.\nWhile not currently possible, if an item has no upgradeable stats,  1000 worth of health (valued at  2.6 per point) is added to the item.[2]\nDecimal values are not displayed for stats in Masterwork items' tooltips, but they are still granted as normal.\nHealth and mana items built on the field will retain Ornn's previous health and mana percentage. Returning to base still brings health and mana back to full.\nOrnn's basic attacks against  Brittle enemies will end the duration of the debuff on-hit prematurely even if the  knock back is not applied.\nHis basic attacks against  Brittle epic  monsters will still render the debuff without the  knock back being applied against them.\n Brittle's  Tenacity reduction will benefit all applicable types of  crowd control, not just  immobilizes. The following do not consume Brittle but benefit from the reduction:  blinds,  cripples,  disarms,  grounding,  silences, and  slows.\n Spell shield will block both the knock back and the bonus damage from Ornn's empowered  brittle attack.\nThe bonus magic damage inflicted by Brittle is credited to Ornn, and benefits from his  magic penetration.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ornn is  channeling:\nAll of Ornn's actions are disabled during the first 0.5 seconds of the channel.\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nAbilities\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nMovement\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll item-actives not specified above interrupt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll summoner spells interrupt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDamaging effectsDeath Cast-inhibiting effects",

She can only use it if her target is within her  attack range while under this condition.\nThe on-target cooldown will apply even if the empowered attack is parried.\nThe empowered attack rolls  critical strike for each shot of the flurry.\nThe bonus magic damage dealt with the blade is  default damage.

This matters for effects that are consumed on-hit (e.g.  Spellblade), which are applied to the target with the lowest Spawn ID.\n\"Spawn ID\" is an unofficial abbreviation to describe the spawn order for all units at the beginning of games, below are some examples.\nIf Senna targets an enemy champion but hits at least one more enemy champion simultaneously,  Press the Attack's first stack will be applied to that target. If no champion was targeted, it will default to the champion with the lowest Spawn ID out of the ones struck by the ability. Whether the effect stacks up on a champion or not when multiple enemy champions are stuck also depends on Spawn ID.\nIf Piercing Darkness struck an enemy champion and turret simultaneously, with  Rapid Firecannon fully charged, the passive effect will most likely proc on the turret since towers are often spawned before champions.\nFor on-attack effects, they are also applied in order of struck units' spawn IDs. However, there are some specific on-attack effects that will apply to both the target of Piercing Darkness and the target with the lowest Spawn ID if the two unit is not identical.

The wraith model does not distinguish which champion is obscured.\nOn the mini-map, obscured champions will be displayed as wraith icons instead of champion icons to the enemy team.\nIn-game, the 'Cloak of Mist' buff grants camouflage and the 'Wraith Form' buff obscures the unit and grants movement speed. However, 'Cloak of Mist' has the unspecified effect of negating the obscuring effects of 'Wraith Form' (i.e. the unit is not a wraith while inside the mist); the unit has the bonus movement speed even when they are not a wraith (e.g. inside the mist or an enemy is nearby); and 'Wraith Form' also grants the functionality of camouflage (i.e. the unit is treated as a camouflaged unit with regards to  True Sight,  Control Wards, and enemy  champions).\nGiven this overly complex interaction between the two buffs granted as well as the overlapping effects, it is easier to describe the effects as a single buff that is modified in specific circumstances rather than trying to establish a new game mechanic.\nSenna likewise has her aura buff and the 'Wraith Form' buff, but her 'Wraith Form' does not share gameplay functionality with other allies benefiting from Wraith Form. For Senna, the appearance of being a wraith is a form-swap while camouflaged (similar to  Evelynn's  Demon Shade). Senna will remain in her wraith form when she is detected so long as the camouflage effect isn't broken, and her wraith's appearance is very distinct from other wraiths.\nAllied champions who enter the mist and have  stealth of their own will still gain the Wraith Form buff but they will not grant  obscured vision of themselves to the enemy while out of the mist nor will they appear as a Wraith.\nAllies who have their own  camouflage and also have Wraith Form will be revealed to enemies from their stealth's detection range, not Wraith Form's.\nIf Senna gains  invisibility while  camouflaged by Curse of the Black Mist, the visual effects of her aura will be hidden while she is invisible.\nCurse of the Black Mist will not activate if Senna enters  resurrection during the cast time.\nWraith Form will not be granted to allies that are in a  zombie state or are  channeling. It will be granted to allies even if they are  untargetable.\nUsing a basic attack breaks the stealth at the start of the attack windup.\nThe stealth regain timer is refreshed from basic attacks at the start of their attack windup.",

          "notes": "Details\n\nSion's death timer starts when he dies and not when Glory in Death ends.\nIf Sion lives longer than what his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until Glory in Death has ended. When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\nThe effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\nThe health loss is unaffected by  Invulnerability.\nGlory in Death has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, Sion dies instantly, regardless of his current health.\nThe healing modifier during Glory in Death reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from Sion himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal.\nThis healing modifier stacks additively with  Spirit Visage and does not stack with heal and shield power.\nThis means that purchasing Spirit Visage enables Sion to have regeneration and use healing effects at 25% effectiveness, and the life steal gained will be increased to 125% as expected.\nThe fixed attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to  1.75, respectively.\nThis also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or  cripples.\nHowever,  Hail of Blades, which allows for the normal attack speed cap ( 3) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, Sion may exceed his  1.75 cap, but cannot fall below it.\nWhen  Hail of Blades ends, the attack speed cap will revert to  3 and not to  1.75, however Sion still can't fall below  1.75.\nSome item passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death.\n Phase Rush cooldown is reset upon entering Glory in Death.\nThe bonus on-hit damage granted by Glory in Death is unaffected by life steal, but is applied against structures that are not turrets.\nHowever, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets.(bug)\nThe reduction of damage against structures includes Sion's attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as  Demolish,  Titanic Hydra and the magic damage based on AP conversion based on  adaptive force.\nIt even includes  true damage from sources such as  Elixir of Sorcery.(note)\nSion, during Glory in Death, will not lose health while being carried by  Fate's Call.\nGlory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\nGlory in Death's  untargetability from the  stasis does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nProjectiles created while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\nUpon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns.\nHowever, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding  crowd control with the exception of  stasis).\nAfter Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground.\nBuffs from jungle monsters that Sion acquired during Glory in Death will not be lost when the duration ends. ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight)\nInteractions & Other\n\nBy surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 41.8k : 443.7k (based on level) in health costs.\nSion can also heal from  spell vamp, althought the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during Glory in Death, since there would be no available abilities that would apply it.\nEven though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\nAt the start of Glory in Death, Sion's  mana drops to 0, but his  mana regeneration will remain in effect.\nZombie info\nZombie states trigger upon taking  lethal damage.\n Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering.\nAll  resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie.\nA champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.\nMost buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.\nThose that persist through death, such as  Brand's  Blaze, will remain.\nUndisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by  Veigar's  Event Horizon and  Viktor's  Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.(bug)\nThis does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state.(bug)\nUnits within a zombie state cannot:\nUse  Recall or  Refillable Potion.\nActivate  resurrection effects.\nTake  Dark Passage, Catapult, or gates.\nInitate the  Rift Herald Rodeo.\nPick up the  Eye of the Herald.\nBe targeted by the following:\n Bailout\n Chronoshift\n Umbral Trespass.\nBe affected by the following:\n Curse of the Black Mist\n Fear Beyond Death's chain missile\n Test of Spirit's initial missile\n Lamb's Respite\n Realm of Death\nFountain health restore",

White cone has a radius of 720, while yellow cone has a radius of 1550. Blue area has the radius of 855 units\nSion himself remains  locked out of all actions for 0.25 seconds when releasing Decimating Smash.\n Soul Furnace can be cast during this time, but  Roar of the Slayer and  Unstoppable Onslaught cannot and neither will they be buffered.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nSince the  stun duration is longer than the  airborne duration, and both start at the same time,  Tenacity is still fully effective against Decimating Smash up to a cap.\nThis virtual cap is 60%-55.5%  Tenacity based on channel time beyond 1 second. Every value below this cap will lower the CC duration with no diminished returns.\nA flash of the axe and change in brightness of the indicator on the ground indicates when the 1 second time frame is reached.\nThe damage of Decimating Smash is calculated when it is released. Gaining AD or upgrading the ability during its channel will update the damage of the coming hit.\nEven though the cooldown starts when the ability is released, it will not be changed by gaining or losing AH, or upgrading the ability, during the cast time.\nThe indicator is visible to the enemy only if they  see Sion himself.\nIf the channel is released before 1 second, enemies may see a particle at the far end of the hitbox, if it itself isn't outside of their  vision.\nIf the channel is released after 1 second, the only remaining indication is the visual effects and audio that plays on any units the spell strikes (these play on-target), provided the enemy does have  vision on those.\nForced movement without a  stun component (or the stun being  cleansed previously) will not stop Sion from starting or continuing to channel. Its direction will not change with Sion's travel, however the location will update with him.\nThe location of the indicator updates at the beginning of the ability, at 1 second and at release.\nThe indicator of the ability is slightly shorter at its front than the hitbox of the ability is for  Original Sion,  Mecha Zero Sion and related skins and chromas, while on  Worldbreaker Sion, the indicator is slightly thinner at the front than the hitbox is, instead.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nCharge channel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.

There is no other difference between normal cast and quick cast for this ability, either.\nThe initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade.\nThe recast does not.\n Zeke's Convergence's Frostfire Tempest will trigger at the end of the charge or  leap.\nCasting  Death Surge will prevent the next Unstoppable Onslaught from triggering Frostfire Tempest.(bug)\nAn enemy can only be affected by Unstoppable Onslaught once every 1 second.\nAfter reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) Sion will transition from using his haste animation to his unique charging one.\nReaching the threshold on  Mecha Zero Sion changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the vehicle.\nThe turning angle is not based on time and can easily be seen in practice when a Sion charges in-place due to bugs.\nSion's movement speed gains during the charge are unaffected by movement speed caps. Effects that would increase or decrease his movement speed do not affect him as well.\n Nami's  Surging Tides is the only known effect that can affect Sion's movement speed during the charge and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the 950 movement speed cap will require  Nami to have over 2150 ability power.\nSion does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\nCasting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the charge's direction.\nThis is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot charge through but can leap over player-generated terrain.\nSion loses the  crowd control immunity after finishing the leap.\nSion is not immune to an allied  Bard's  Tempered Fate if it hits Sion during the 0.05-second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the slam immediately while in  stasis.(bug)\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second.\nEven though the cooldown of Unstoppable Onslaught starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing ability haste, or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n Removing the  airborne before 0.5 seconds will not prevent the  stun from being applied.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nSion can occasionally cast Unstoppable Onslaught while  rooted. In this case, he will stand in place until the root's debuff duration ends. During this time, the damage, stun duration and movement speed granted by the ability will still ramp up, and enemies that come into contact with him will be affected by the collision normally.(bug)\nA similar case allows him to cast it during crowd control that would disable it. However, the channel would be interrupted almost immediately, and he will initiate the leap as well.\n Fate's Call deferment of Unstoppable Onslaught will still allow Sion to leap forward at the end of the channel.\nMoving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not jeopardize the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught. The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element.\nPENDING FOR TEST: The distance between Sion's center and the center of the ground slam scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of charge time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\nPENDING FOR TEST: The leap appears to always have the same speed regardless of Sion's, at roughly 750.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.  Decimating Smash and  Roar of the Slayer are disabled. This ability recasts to end channel.\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed, but cannot input movement commands.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll summoner spells are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath\n\nIf Unstoppable Onslaught's channel is interrupted despite the immunity to crowd control or  Decimating Smash is cast within 0.25 seconds after starting the charge, it will also initiate the leap. If the channel ends due to collision or death, there is no  leap and the effect occurs immediately.",

It is currently unknown if the change was intentional or not, but seems to be partially intentional based on observation.\nThe afformentioned unit types and inhibitors are considered \"valid\" for Shattered Earth and will only trigger its effects when the main target was one of those. This includes:\nTriggering the damaging area of effect,\nRefreshing the duration when an empowered attack has begun,\nand consume empowered attacks only when they landed. (This way the attacks are not consumed when the target died beforehand.)\nAttacking any other units will cause Skarner to use his normal basic attacks instead while Shattered Earth is expiring (but still benefit from the increased attack speed and range).\nTo be more precise about Ixtal's Impact's duration pause, it adds 0.25 seconds to the duration every 0.25 seconds, but will set it to an estimated minimum of 1.5 seconds if it would have been lower.\nThe  slow applied by Shattered Earth is a generic slow debuff.\nInteractions & Other\nThe attack reset will not save time if Skarner possesses sufficiently high attack speed because of the ability's 0.35 seconds cast time. Starting from around  271.4285% bonus attack speed, basic attacking is fast enough to match the time with the reset and will be even faster with more, causing Shattered Earth to actually slow down the user at that point.\nHowever, this only takes attack speed into account and ignores various other factors, such as the damage and other bonuses from the ability and the fact that Skarner generally does not like building such high amounts of attack speed. Additionally, attempting to do the attack reset at such high attack speed is already a hard task, if not requires frame perfect execution to save any ticks worth of time.\nKnown issues\nSkarner's attack speed is not immediately updated upon casting Shattered Earth. Beginning the first attack shortly after casting results in an attack that does not benefit from the attack speed granted by the ability.\nIf Upheaval hits an enemy while a new instance of Shattered Earth is active, Shattered Earth's effects are immediately lost.\nWhile Shattered Earth is active, it will not benefit from cooldown refund effects such as  Transcendence or  Navori Flickerblade's Transcendence.\nEditor's note: This is not a Skarner-specific issue. Various abilities, including Ultimates, that grant a different ability in their slot after activation may suffer from this problem (e.g.  Briar's  Blood Frenzy and  Snack Attack) and may be fixed or may have been fixed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe empowered attacks lack spell effects as they deal  proc damage, which does not match with how empowered attacks supposed to behave in general.\nEditor's note: This is possibly a band-aid fix to avoid an issue where Shattered Earth would trigger various effects twice per attack instead of once, as it could be seen during the first PBE deploy of the rework's release, after which the ability was changed from spell damage to proc.\nThe buff used for Shattered Earth is fuzzy. Each attack removes 1 stack on a delay of up to 0.25 seconds. This has no known side effects currently.\nThe slow is also applied and removed in a fuzzy manner, meaning that sometimes it may last shorter or longer than intended, depending on the ticks.",

Devoted to keeping his nation safe from the rest of the world, Skarner dwells in a chamber beneath Ixaocan where he can hear the vibrations of the earth and detect potential threats. As more members of the Yun Tal begin questioning Ixtal's self-isolation, Skarner grows increasingly paranoid and will do anything to keep Ixtal and its people safe—no matter the cost."

Sylas will not receive a Hijacked  Golden Eclipse.\nIf Sylas casts Hijack on a  clone, no ultimate is stolen and the ability will be placed on full cooldown.\nThe same does not occur for champions within a  zombie state.\n Clones do not copy Hijack's target cooldown indicator, potentially revealing them to Sylas.\n Neeko's  Inherent Glamour does not hide her personal cooldown indicator, nor does she copy her allies'.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\nIf the same happens when casting an on-target stolen ability, the ability will instead cancel and go on cooldown.\nIf Hijack is intercepted by  Braum's  Unbreakable, Sylas will gain a copy of  Glacial Fissure instead and an on-target cooldown will be applied to him.\nIf  Braum has an on-target cooldown on him (by being previously Hijacked) upon interception, no ultimate will be stolen.\nSince the copied ability scales based on Hijack's rank, abilities can be copied regardless of their rank.\nHijack will copy all passives, actives and recast effects of the stolen ability. Hijack will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary.\nShape-shifting ultimates will transform Sylas into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and base stats. Namely:  Cougar Form,  Spider Form,  Cannon Form and  Dragon Form.\nDragon's Descent transforms Sylas'  mana, into Shyvana's  fury, being able to replenishing it by basic attacking. At the end of the effect, Sylas gains his previous mana.\nDragon's Descent does not refresh ability cooldowns upon transforming.\nSpider Form freezes Sylas' original cooldowns on their current values, causing them to not come off cooldown during Spider Form. (bug)\nUpon transforming back from  Cannon Form, Sylas' next basic attack deals  Transform Mercury Hammer's bonus magic damage and uses his critical strike animation.\nTransforming into  Cannon Form with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting  Hypercharge will limit its effect until the currently held Unshackled stacks are spent. (bug)\nTransforming into Cougar Form with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting  Takedown will disable Takedown's effect until the buff timer runs out. (bug)\nPermanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off.\nThe alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).\nUpon transforming, a  Petricite Burst stack will be deducted.\n Petricite Burst stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones.\nIf Sylas has both normal and transformed stacks, Petricite Burst will prioritize consuming Sylas stacks before the transformed ones.\nUltimates comply with  One for All rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied  Darius'  Hemorrhage stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked  Noxian Guillotine; or an allied  Syndra's  Dark Sphere will add extra damage to hijacked  Unleashed Power as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.\nUltimate Interactions\n Ahri's  Spirit Rush - Gains a charge upon scoring a champion  takedown within 3 seconds of damaging them.\n Akshan's  Comeuppance - Sylas can cast  Abscond, but doing so ends the channel prematurely. If Comeuppance is cast after  Abduct but before the chains hit a target, Sylas isn't pulled to the target and the channel continues as usual.\n Amumu's  Curse of the Sad Mummy - Does not apply  Cursed Touch.\n Aphelios'  Moonlight Vigil - Based on the  main weapon at the moment of steal.\n Crescendum empowers his basic attacks temporarily.\n Calibrum does not apply marks.\n Severum grants a shield if healed while at full health.\n Ashe's  Enchanted Crystal Arrow - Does not apply  Frost Shot to secondary targets.\n Brand's  Pyroclasm - Does not apply stacks of  Blaze.\n Cho'Gath's  Feast - Gains permanent Feast stacks on-kill.\n Corki's  Missile Barrage - Gains max charges.\n Darius'  Noxian Guillotine - Does not apply a stack of  Hemorrhage. Upon gaining a reset from a Rank 3 Noxian Guillotine, Sylas can hold onto the ability for up to 300 seconds.\n Fiora's  Grand Challenge - Gains movement speed in the effect and deals bonus  Vitals true damage and can trigger the area healing.\n Galio's  Hero's Entrance - Gives Sylas and allies  Shield of Durand's magic  shield, based on  Kingslayer rank.\n Gangplank's  Cannon Barrage - Does not steal cannon upgrades.\n Gnar's  GNAR! - Gains a usable ultimate regardless of cast on  Mini Gnar or  Mega Gnar.\n Gwen's  Needlework - Does not apply  A Thousand Cuts.\n Heimerdinger's  UPGRADE!!! - Sylas's basic abilities are replaced with Heimerdinger's empowered abilities. The upgrade buff lasts until the ultimate can be stolen again.\n Illaoi's  Leap of Faith - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Kingslayer.\n Irelia's  Vanguard's Edge - Applies marks of  Bladesurge.\n Jax's  Grandmaster-at-Arms - Applies magic damage on-hit while holding onto Grandmaster-at-Arms and while it is active.\n Kassadin's  Riftwalk - Only provides one use.\n Kai'Sa's  Killer Instinct - Sylas' basic attacks,  Abduct and nearby allies'  immobilizations apply stacks of  Plasma, up to 4. Sylas is unable to apply the 5th stack necessary to expunge the stacks.\n Kalista's  Fate's Call - Only castable with a  link (purchasable in the Shop for  0 gold).\n Karma's  Mantra - Sylas' basic abilities are replaced with Karma's empowered abilities, according to Sylas' own ability ranks (including Hijack for Mantra bonuses).\n Katarina's  Death Lotus - Can be cast without a target.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass - Based on current form ( Shadow Assassin /  Rhaast).\n Kha'Zix's  Void Assault - Can steal the ability's  evolution bonus effects.\n Kennen's  Slicing Maelstrom - Applies  Mark of the Storm.\n Kled's  Chaaaaaaaarge!!! - Does not need  mount to cast.\n Kog'Maw's  Living Artillery - Only provides one use.\n LeBlanc's  Mimic - Uses the empowered version of  LeBlanc's last cast basic ability.  Mimic Sigil of Malice does not apply its mark. If she has not cast any abilities,  Mimic Sigil of Malice is copied.\n Leona's  Solar Flare - Does not apply  Sunlight.\n Lillia's  Lilting Lullaby - Sylas' abilities apply  Dream-Laden Bough's debuff, which does not deal its damage over time.\n Lucian's  The Culling - Can cast  Abscond and  Abduct freely during the channel.\n Lux's  Final Spark - Does not apply  Illumination.\n Master Yi's  Highlander -  Takedowns reduce basic ability cooldowns while holding onto Highlander and while it is active.\n Mel's  Golden Eclipse - Sylas' basic attacks and abilities apply stacks of  Overwhelm, which will execute targets below the threshold.\n Mordekaiser's  Realm of Death - Can join the dimension of outgoing realms if cast in the proper range (does not extend their duration).\n Nasus'  Fury of the Sands - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Chain Lash.\n Neeko's  Inherent Glamour - Always steals  Pop Blossom, regardless of the champion Neeko is disguised as.\n Orianna's  Command: Shockwave - Cast on self without a  Ball.\n Pantheon's  Grand Starfall - The spear deals damage based on  Chain Lash rank and scales with 46% AP.\n Quinn's  Behind Enemy Lines - Does not cast  Skystrike upon attacking an enemy champion. It can be casted manually however.\n Rengar's  Thrill of the Hunt - Sylas will gain  Unseen Predator on his next attack.\n Renekton's  Dominus - Grants Sylas 20 mana on cast and then 5 mana per second (up to 75 total mana over the duration).\n Rek'Sai's  Void Rush - Sylas' attacks against enemy champions will apply a  mark which can be used to cast the ability.\n Riven's  Blade of the Exile - Grants AD based on Sylas' AP on cast and grants him 75 bonus attack range for his auto attacks aswell for  Chain Lash and  Kingslayer.\n Samira's  Inferno Trigger - Can use without a  Grade.\n Seraphine's  Encore - Allies do not gain  Notes.\n Shaco's  Hallucinate - Creates a Sylas Clone that also copies Sylas' stolen ultimate indicator. The clone behaves like a Shaco clone, being able to  Backstab, apply  Two-Shiv Poison's slow scaling with  Abscond rank, and summoning  mini-boxes that deal damage based on  Hijack rank.\n Shyvana's  Dragon's Descent - Has a 200 second base cooldown.\n Skarner's  Impale - Can freely cast abilities during the suppression, but cannot basic attack or  Flash.\n Sylas'  Hijack - Steals the ability that the enemy Sylas has stolen. Cannot be targeted if no ability has been stolen.\n Syndra's  Unleashed Power - Throws a minimum of 3  spheres, which are left on the ground afterwards and vanish after 6 seconds.\n Talon's  Shadow Assault - Does not apply  Blade's End.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour - Sylas' basic attacks apply  An Acquired Taste, allowing him to cast Devour on enemies.\n Teemo's  Noxious Trap - Gains max charges.\n Tristana's  Buster Shot - Always has 525 cast range as Sylas does not benefit from  Draw a Bead's per-level cast range increase.\n Twitch's  Spray and Pray - Gains 300 attack range and his attacks produce missiles that travel 850 range.

Similarly, if the suppression is removed, the displacement from the pull is stopped.\nThe attachment also depends upon the occurrence of the pull; if the target is not pulled, they are not attached to Tahm Kench and the swallow fails, cancelling the ability entirely.\nIf the target resists the suppression by being  immune to crowd control,  displacement immune, or having a  spell shield, Tahm Kench will not pull the target towards him.\nIf the target removes the suppression by any means, including with an applicable  cleanse effect or  dispel, one of two of the following interactions will occur based on the timing of the removal:\nIf the suppression was removed during Devour's cast time, the target will stop the displacement from the pull instantly and prevent themselves from being attached to Tahm Kench after the cast time.\nIf the suppression was removed while the target is attached to Tahm Kench (in other words, inside of his belly), the target will detach themselves from him instantly without Tahm Kench performing  Regurgitate.\nThe  untargetability and  displacement immunity is granted to the target during Devour's cast time as well. Enemies are granted these effects while they are suppressed; they are removed when the suppression is.\nDevour's suppression against enemies is removed if Tahm Kench dies, enters  resurrection, or transitions in or out of the  Realm of Death.\nEnemies will be dealt  Regurgitate's damage regardless of Tahm Kench casting the ability if Devour's suppression ends by any means other than transitioning out of  Realm of Death(bug) or  dismounting(bug) (including during Devour's cast time).\nIf the target transitions into the  Realm of Death or enters  resurrection, Tahm Kench will  Regurgitate them automatically.\nThis only occurs for the former if Tahm Kench is in a different dimension from the target.\nDevour cannot be used on allies that are  channeling or using an ability that preloads UnstoppableForceMarker.\nThe  self-slow is affected by  slow resist.\nTahm Kench cannot use gates during Devour.\nAllies can see if this spell is ready next to Tahm Kench's health bar.\nThe swallowed target is not considered to be  vanished. They are instead hidden below the visible map plane, to maintain ongoing effects such as  Senna's  Curse of the Black Mist.\nDuring Devour's attachment and  Regurgitate's displacement, the swallowed target's camera is locked and centered on their champion.\nThis does not affect Tahm Kench.\nThe following table refers for interactions while the target is unable to act:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nIf an ally, forces Tahm Kench to use  Regurgitate unless movement commands are otherwise restricted.

Thresh will only tug if the target remains  stunned and he has not casted Deathly Leap.\nThresh will not tug his hook at all if the stun was not applied to the target.\nThese displacements will not be resisted by  displacement immunity or  crowd control immunity.(note)\nThe first tug occurs after the 0.1-second delay, while the second tug occurs after 0.7 seconds of the target being stunned (or 0.6 seconds from the end of the initial delay).\nThe initial  airborne debuff that is applied to the target upon hitting them is removed if the displacement from the first pull is interrupted.\nThe target will not be pulled with the tugs if they are too close to Thresh.\nDeath Sentence cannot be recast while  grounded or  rooted.\nDeath Sentence can be recast even while the target is  untargetable.\nDeath Sentence will not  stun enemies that are  displacement immune or  immune to crowd control but the target will still be marked and Thresh is still granted the ability to recast for his dash.\n Spell shield will block all of Death Sentence's effects, including the mark as well as prevent the cooldown reduction.\nDeath Sentence's  stun duration is affected by  tenacity but the mark will always persist for 1.5 seconds, unless the target uses a  cleansing effect, in which case the mark is removed.\nDeath Sentence's  stun will persist even if Thresh dies before the duration ends. The tugs will not occur as Thresh is not alive.\nThe reveal lingers for 0.05 seconds after it ends.\nDeathly Leap has a maximum cast range of ~3000 units. If Thresh or the target move a greater distance than this away from one another while the target is marked, Deathly Leap can still be cast but will fail to trigger the dash.(bug)\nThresh will turn his facing direction towards the cast direction only after Death Sentence's cast is complete.\nIf Thresh is facing more than 90° away from the cast direction in either direction, he will turn to face exactly 90° away from the cast direction over the cast time, then turn towards the cast direction when the missile is fired.\nIf Thresh is facing less than 90° away from the cast direction, he will keep his facing direction until the missile is fired.\nThis prevents the enemy from knowing where exactly Thresh is aiming at before the cast animation is complete.\nDeath Sentence triggers on-cast effects (such as  Spellblade and triggering  Force Pulse's passive) once at the start of the cast, and once at the end of the cast. It may trigger on-cast effects a third time when casting Deathly Leap.\nThis is because a separate spell is cast to prevent Thresh from facing towards the target direction immediately, which is (incorrectly) flagged to trigger on-cast effects.(bug)\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",

Every cast of the active is a separate cast instance:\nHitting a champion with the passive by killing a nearby unit, casting the active on them (see note above) and landing a basic attack against them triggers  Electrocute.\nHitting a champion with the passive by killing a nearby unit, casting the active on them and hitting them again with the Passive by killing another nearby unit does not trigger  Electrocute.\n Dodge,  block and  blind all prevent Explosive Charge's stack application via basic attacks.\nExplosive Charge's detonation will deal damage to the primary target even if they have become  untargetable.\nExplosive Charge's stacks from basic attacks are applied as an on-hit effect and will therefore interact with  Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and  Runaan's Hurricane's bolts.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).",

The target will still be untargetable, prevented from taking damage from other sources, and suppressed during this time.\nIf Urgot is  channeling a spell, the channel is interrupted when the chains hit.\nRemoving or resisting the  slow has no effect on the mark debuff.\nThe initial cast always counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade and triggering  Force Pulse's passive.\nIf the ability hits a target who is below the threshold, it will automatically recast itself and it won't be considered as an ability activation.\nIf the ability hits a target who is above the threshold and it's recast early, the recast will happen automatically when they reach the threshold and it won't be considered as an ability activation.\nIf the target got hit while above the threshold and it is recast after they fall below it, the recast will be considered as an ability activation.\nReactivating the ability early will reel the target as soon as they reach the 25% maximum health threshold.\nMercy can be cast and will automatically do so at the end of the duration if the target is below the execute threshold regardless of Urgot being affected by  crowd control, including self or enemy-imposed  stasis.\nFear Beyond Death can affect  clones and activates its fear when executing one.\nFear Beyond Death's recast cannot be used if the target is  untargetable.\nFear Beyond Death's recast cannot be used during  resurrection. Attempting to do so places the recast on a 5-second  cooldown.\nIf the target is below the threshold at the end of the duration and Urgot is revived, the recast will initiate regardless of this cooldown.\nThe recast's chains are classified as a  projectile and they will fail to affect their target if:\nUrgot or his target  dies or enters  resurrection.\nThe target becomes  untargetable, even if the granted source does not  destroy in-flight projectiles.\nUrgot will also fail to execute the target if they become  untargetable while the chains are being pulled.(note)\nThey collide with  Wind Wall or  Unbreakable.\nIf  Unbreakable intercepts the chains and  Braum is not the target, they're destroyed.\nIf  Braum is the target, he will still be reeled in and executed as normal.\nThe target is  crowd control immune when the chains hit.\nThe target is  a zombie.\n Spell shield will not block the recast's chains.\nIf the target removes the  suppression by any means they will prevent themselves from being  executed and stop the forced movement from being renewed, though allowing the most recent one to be present and move them to Urgot's previous location.\nTheir untargetability and damage prevention of other sources granted by Fear Beyond Death is removed in the process.\nUrgot will still complete the full channel despite this.\nThe execution would not count as being successful in this case and thus he will not  fear nearby enemies after the failed execution.\nIf the target is  displacement immune when the chains collide, Urgot will not begin the channel until after their displacement immunity ends.\nThe target will be unaffected by Fear Beyond Death's forced movement during this time, but will still be suppressed, prevented from taking damage from other sources and rendered untargetable.\nIf the target's displacement immunity does not end within 10 seconds, Fear Beyond Death will cancel.\nWhen the chains start reeling in and suppressing a player's champion, chains will also cover the sides of their screen.\nThe target champion shrinks in size in several steps after reaching Urgot's grinder and before being executed.\nIf the suppression ends in any way, the target returns to its normal size.\nIf the execution is successful, the victim's corpse will be effectively invisible unless they enter a  zombie state.\nThe target will die regardless of their current health once the recast's chains hit, even if they are  healed.\nIf the target has  invulnerability that persists for the duration of the channel, it will protect them from the execution.\n Undying Rage will prevent  Tryndamere from dying by the execute. In this case, the execute will bypass his minimum health threshold though and reduce him to 1 health.\nThe effect will also not prevent the activation of  resurrection effects, such as  Guardian Angel or  Anivia's  Rebirth.\nPost-death events such as  Zombie State effects (e.g,  Karthus'  Death Defied,  Kog'Maw's  Icathian Surprise, and  Sion's  Glory in Death) will be triggered.\nOnly the target's current health will count as Urgot's damage in post-game statistics and  spell vamp healing.\nFear Beyond Death's initial cast will not perform the automatic recast from dealing enough damage to kill  Sion.\nFear Beyond Death's recast will be placed on a 5-second  cooldown if the target is below the threshold and becomes targetable again after completing the dash from  Hero's Entrance.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Urgot is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",

Bound in iron chains, he was forced to learn the true meaning of strength in the Dredge—a prison mine deep beneath Zaun. Emerging in a disaster that spread chaos throughout the city, he now casts an imposing shadow over its criminal underworld. Raising his victims on the very chains that once enslaved him, he will purge his new home of the unworthy, making it a crucible of pain."

          "notes": "Details\n\nJaws of the Beast deals  basic damage, but also triggers spell effects by also being tagged as  spell damage.\nJaws of the Beast has a 0.264 seconds cast delay, which is the amount of time required for the bite to occur from the start of the cast. This should not be confused with a cast time.\nIf the cast started beforehand, both the damage and the heal occur even after Warwick's  death, or during  resurrection.\nIf the target dies prior to Warwick reaching them, Jaws of the Beast refunds its cooldown when tapped. The ability can be still held, however, Warwick is no longer eligible for the refund in this case.  Editor's note: The refund can occasionally fail. (bug)\nThe healing is calculated only from Jaws of the Beast's damage, while additional effects, such as on-hits, are not.\nWhile the bite always occurs after the same delay, the time spent lunging does not, which depends on the range Jaws of the Beast was cast away from the target, up to 0.5 seconds when cast at maximum range.\nThis does not affect the  lockout timer, which is the same as the bite's delay.\nThe lunge always places Warwick to his attack range to the center of his target, while the dash will place him up to the edge of his attack range from the target's edge.\nIt has been special cased so Warwick does not follow an enemy's  Recall or a  Sion that revives from  Glory in Death.Editor's note: This may occasionally fail. Also note that as of currently, if Warwick manages to bite the target in those conditions, he will almost always end up following them to their base. (bug)\nJaws of the Beast's channel cannot be initiated while  grounded or  rooted. Warwick can only use the normal cast.\nThe channel will not be interrupted by either of the two effects, despite the lock-on being a movement channel.\nInteractions & Other\n\nIn order to hit the cap, the target monster needs to have at least 2500 / 2358 / 2250 / 2167 / 2100 health.\nJaws of the Beast is the only ability in the game that combines  channeling with  displacement immunity. Every  interrupting crowd control effect that is not resisted by the displacement immunity will prematurely stop the  dash.\nThe bite can still occur if cast before the crowd control application, but Warwick cannot start channeling.\nAbilities that apply both  stun and  airborne at the same time cause Warwick to ignore the displacement, but prematurely stop the channel and the dash.\nThe only exception to this is  Sion's  Glory in Death.\nWarwick will follow enemies that move via  attachment effects but the lock-on will not be extended.\nWhile Jaws of the Beast does not use Quick Casting by default, click-and-hold is comparable to the input required to use  Bone Skewer or  Comet Spear. It does not accept two-click input (e.g. First Cast and Recast) that abilities like  Piercing Arrow or  Decimating Smash use in Standard Casting.\nWarwick will attempt to basic attack the target after a short delay.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Warwick is  channeling:\n Flash,  Teleport,  Hexflash, and  Recall are disabled during the first 0.4 seconds of the channel.\n\n\nType\n\nCharge channel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Primal Howl is usable.  Blood Hunt and  Infinite Duress are disabled.\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll item-actives not specified above interrupt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Cast-inhibiting effects\n\nKnown Issues\n\nJaws of the Beast will also refund its  cooldown if it kills the target after being held for exactly its bite delay. (bug)\nThe ability may briefly cast on a dead target, with the ability going on cooldown.(bug)",

In either case Yasuo still gains a stack of Gathering Storm and his whirlwind knock-up cannot be negated by parries:\n Dodge: both first target and secondary target do not take damage.\n Block: first target does not take damage, secondary target does take damage.\n Blind: both first target and secondary target do take damage.\nSteel Tempest rolls its  critical strikes individually against each enemy hit.\nCasting  Last Breath during Steel Tempest will buffer it to cast after the cast time has completed.\nHowever, if  Last Breath is used on a target affected by an  airborne source that is not Yasuo, it is cast immediately due to Steel Tempest's cast time ending prematurely. Steel Tempest will still cast in this case.\n Spell shield does not prevent a stack of Gathering Storm from being gained.\nWhile at two stacks, a range indicator will be shown for the effective range of the whirlwind.",

          "notes": "Last Breath can be cast on targets  suspended in mid-air by  Nami's  Aqua Prison's  stun.\nThe wiki has adopted the term suspension for this unique property due to a statement by Yasuo's designer.[2]\nThe percentage bonus armor penetration stacks multiplicatively with other sources of percentage armor penetration.\nLast Breath requires the target to be affected by  airborne from an enemy source, and simultaneously that the target is not considered  cc-immune,  displacement immune, or  untargetable during it.\nLast Breath cannot be cast if there are no nearby enemy champions that meet the conditions.\nAttempting to cast the ability on an enemy champion that is not airborne will indicate that they \"Must Be Airborne!\".\n Spell shield will not prevent Last Breath from being cast and the target will be knocked up and dealt the damage.\nThe spell shield is still consumed in this case.(note)\nSelf-applied or allied-applied  displacements do not allow Last Breath to target the champion. Those applied by the neutral team (e.g.  Dragon's initial knock back) can be targeted.\nAn indicator will be placed towards enemy champions that meet the cast conditions within range of Last Breath to signify the ability can be cast.\n The Hextech Ultimatum will prevent Yasuo from casting Last Breath on an airborne enemy champion far outside its borders.\nYasuo can only do so if the airborne enemy champion is positioned slightly outside of the borders.\nUpon Last Breath's cast, the targets' facing directions snap to Yasuo. Afterwards, their facing directions shift in all other directions every 0.25 seconds over the duration of the airborne.\nThe last shift snaps them to the facing direction of the second one.\nOn the  Nightbringer Yasuo skin, these shifts in facing direction do not occur, but the targets' facing directions will still snap to Yasuo upon Last Breath's cast.\nYasuo does not need  sight of enemy champions near his target to affect them with the ability.\nLast Breath applies its damage and removes its forced movement on the target when it ends, including if it is removed early by being  cleansed.\nThis is in contrast to most other effects with  airborne, which have their forced movement linger if the disabling debuff is removed and have to be overridden by another movement spell (such as  Lucian's  Relentless Pursuit or  Flash).\nIt behaves similar to  Nami's  Aqua Prison in this but is not considered  suspension.\nTerrain displacing abilities (e.g.  Weaver's Wall,  Pillar of Ice,  Volcanic Rupture) that affect enemy champions are considered  airborne, and will therefore interact with Last Breath.\nWhile blinking, Yasuo creates an  untargetable clone of himself that cues a dashing animation (similar to  Sweeping Blade's) towards the target. This unit's rules do not follow those of a  clone's. As such, it is more alike a champion, unless special cased.\nWhile performing Last Breath, Yasuo is  locked out of performing actions.\nThe lock out will end prematurely if all targets:\n Cleanse the  knock up.\nMove far away from Yasuo.\nLeave Yasuo's  sight (e.g. by  nearsight).\nBecome  untargetable.\n Die.\nEnter the  Realm of Death.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yasuo is locked out:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A",

For example,  turret shots will appear as if they were hitting the Anchor, but in reality they're actually hitting Yuumi.\nHowever, for the purposes of You and Me!, such as casting it or being unattached for other reasons, Yuumi will be in the position where she visually is. For example, when she is in the blue team, dashing to a north-east ally is considerably slower than dashing to a south-west ally.\nHer  monster aggression transfers to the Anchor.\nEnemies gain an assist on Yuumi if they damaged the Anchor.\nYuumi will always be  visible if her Anchor can be seen, and she will always not be visible if her Anchor cannot be seen. These rules apply regardless of  reveal effects and  stealth.\nYuumi will not  vanish if her Anchor does.\nIf Yuumi is on the blue team, she will remain attached on the southwest side; if Yuumi is on the red team, she will remain on the northeast. While channeling  Final Chapter, she will be behind her Anchor.\nThe player's screen will briefly flash red if Yuumi is affected by a  immobilizing or  grounding effect, or if she forcibly detaches from her Anchor.\nThe Anchor's health bar will have a different frame to indicate the attached status:\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is  attached:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nAllowed\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nAll the other item-actives are usable\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",

They will not prevent Zed from initiating Death Mark against the target nor block the detonation from a mark that is already applied.\nIf Zed dies during Death Mark, the ability will cancel instantly and he will reappear at his current location. The cooldown is not refunded.\nIf he enters  resurrection before the dash, Death Mark does not cancel. If he enters it while dashing, the dash is interrupted.\nIf the  dash is interrupted, Zed stops, places himself to the ground (ends all displacements affecting him, but does not remove  airborne effects), and reappears prematurely at his current location. The mark will still be applied regardless.\nZed will remove  airborne effects from himself immediately upon starting the dash.\nOnce Zed begins the  dash, two  Shadows will also appear to be dashing through his target, each one spawning a certain distance behind the target (from the right and left). These shadows do not mimic abilities and disappear immediately after they stop dashing but they grant  sight of their surroundings.\nThese shadows have a tracking distance of 2200 and a dash speed of 1750.\nDeath Mark does not cancel if the target enters a  zombie state before the dash begins.\nIf the mark's post-mitigation damage is higher than the target's current health, a spinning shuriken will appear above the victim. This does not necessarily mean the target will die, as it does not consider  shields or forms of damage modifiers that are not respected by this predictive calculation.\n\nThe indicator shown in-game (base skin).\n\nThis following table refers for interactions while Zed is in Death Mark:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash  Mark  Dash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",

The rounds will still deal damage to enemies hit.\nBurst Fire's rounds are each fired in the target direction from where Zeri is at the time.\nOnly attack speed granted by being  Overcharged can exceed the cap of 1.5.\n Hail of Blades does not allow Zeri to exceed her attack speed cap.\nItems and runes that trigger off of attacking [eg  Fleet Footwork,  Kraken Slayer] will only trigger if Burst Fire hits a unit.\nIf Zeri would get full Energized stacks from a Burst Fire, the rest of the rounds will trigger Energized.\nBurst Fire's cast-indicator does not show  range increases; modified range VFX are still visible around the champion model.\nBurst Fire can apply the effect of  Horizon Focus when the enemy hit is within the last 50 units of this ability.(note)\nBurst Fire uses a modified icon when empowered by  Spark Surge () and  Lightning Crash () as well as both ().\nDestroying a ward that is targetable but not visible to Zeri's team (e.g. a  Control Ward in Fog of War) via Burst Fire uniquely allows her to remove its accompanying ward timer (if it exists) without seeing the ward being destroyed.",

If Sleepy Trouble Bubble is cast right before she blinks back to Portal Jump's original cast position, the range of the missile will be extended for it to fire to the same end position as if she had not blinked back. This interaction occurs in this manner due to the missile's behavior as explained prior and the fact that Zoe blinks back with Portal Jump before the cast time of Sleepy Trouble Bubble finishes, causing the cast time to finish from Portal Jump's original cast position.\nIf the bonus damage from \"Sleepy Trouble Bubble\" is applied from an ally champion, the bonus damage is applied before the damage from the allied champion.\nIf the bonus damage is enough to kill the enemy champion, Zoe will be awarded the kill credit and the allied champion will not be granted an assist (unless a different assist-granting interaction occurred).\nThis will still count as damage dealt by Zoe in the damage recap.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
