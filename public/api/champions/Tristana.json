Every cast of the active is a separate cast instance:\nHitting a champion with the passive by killing a nearby unit, casting the active on them (see note above) and landing a basic attack against them triggers  Electrocute.\nHitting a champion with the passive by killing a nearby unit, casting the active on them and hitting them again with the Passive by killing another nearby unit does not trigger  Electrocute.\n Dodge,  block and  blind all prevent Explosive Charge's stack application via basic attacks.\nExplosive Charge's detonation will deal damage to the primary target even if they have become  untargetable.\nExplosive Charge's stacks from basic attacks are applied as an on-hit effect and will therefore interact with  Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and  Runaan's Hurricane's bolts.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).",
