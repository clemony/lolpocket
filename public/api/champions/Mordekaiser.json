        "notes": "Mordekaiser's Realm of Death. Champions outside of the death realm are seen as spirits. Blue spirits (above Mordekaiser) are allied champions while red spirits (below Mordekaiser) are enemy champions.\nAlly spirit\nEnemy spirit\nThe Realm of Death is a battlefield that exists outside of the normal realm in an alternate \"dimension\". It exists only for Mordekaiser and his target. It consists of an arena that has a radius of 1200 units and includes any terrain features that would exist in the map of the normal realm, including walls and  brushes.\nThe boundaries of the arena are impassable but not considered terrain themselves ( Unstoppable Onslaught exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.\n Dashes,  blinks,  displacements and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\nRealm of Death retains Mordekaiser's previous current health percentage when granting him a portion of the target's maximum health.\nRealm of Death will cancel and go on cooldown after its cast time if:\nThe target is  displacement immune,  crowd control immune or protected by a  spell shield.\nNote that all of the above plus any  cleanse effect are ineffective if they are applied after the target has been banished.\nThe target is a  clone or  Sion's  Glory in Death.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\nMordekaiser will reduce the target's bonus armor and magic resistance, but not their base attack damage.\nPENDING FOR TEST: Reduces bonus or base health?\nIf Mordekaiser or the target cast another Realm of Death, the affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\nThe previous circle will be overridden by the new one; it will be dispelled to enter the new circle.\n Spell shield will not block the initial  slow.\nThe reveal effect lasts for 1.25 seconds from the start of the cast time if the cast does not complete. Otherwise, the reveal ends as soon as the cast time completes.\nIf the target's  health is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health. Mordekaiser will still get the usual amount of maximum health.\nEntering or leaving the Death Realm will cause all targeted  projectiles to be  destroyed.\nThe transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt  channels.\n Grand Starfall will always be interrupted by the transition into the realm.\nRealm of Death will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter  resurrection after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a  zombie state.\nAny active  tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\nUpon entering the realm, Mordekaiser and the target are  cleansed from all  forced action effects\nThe cleanse will occur even if the source enters the realm.(bug)\nUnlike the other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\nMordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\nWhile Mordekaiser has hold of his enemy's stats, that champion's circular portrait will appear as a pip next to his health bar, visible to all players.\nRealm of Death's interactions with other elements/abilities (list is incomplete):\nMultiple Death Realms (possible through a  hijacked Realm of Death or if multiple Mordekaisers are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\nHex-gates on  Hextech Rift will not be present between realms.\n Brushes will maintain their presence between realms.\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass will cause him to detach immediately when Realm of Death ends.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\n Camille's  The Hextech Ultimatum, catching  Draven's  Spinning Axe,  Ekko's  Timewinder and  Parallel Convergence,  Malzahar's  Null Zone,  Maokai's  Twisted Advance,  Lulu's  Pix,  Pyke's  Death from Below,  Taliyah's  Worked Grounds,  Viktor's  Gravity Field,  Ziggs'  Satchel Charge, and  Rift Scuttler's  Speed Shrine are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions if the conditions are valid.\nEffects such as  Requiem,  Absolute Zero,  Grand Starfall and  Final Spark will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\n Akali's  Shuriken Flip can be recast even if the target is in another realm.\n Kindred's  Lamb's Respite is one of many area of effect abilities that will not take presence between realms.\n Malzahar's  Void Shift is special cased to not resist the slow but instead resist the dimension swap after the cast completes.\n Nocturne's  Paranoia only applies  nearsight to enemy champions in the same dimension as him.\n Orianna's  Ball will snap back to her the moment she switches realms.\n Sion's  Decimating Smash will stay in the realm Sion was in at the beginning of the  charge.\nThe target of  Devour will immediately leave  Tahm Kench's belly when he enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Taliyah's  Weaver's Wall is interrupted both for if she enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Urgot's  Fear Beyond Death cannot be recast while the target is in a different dimension than him. If the target is being reeled in however, then the execution at the end of the channel will take place regardless of the dimension either he or the target is in.\nThe fear upon a successful execution will occur in  Urgot's realm.\n Viego's  Mist Wraiths will spawn between realms.  Harrowed Path will also take presence between realms.\n Volibear's  Sky Splitter will only affect targets in the same realm as it was cast.\n Xayah's  Bladecaller cannot call  Feathers between dimensions.\n Zed's  Shadows will take presence between realms.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Realm of Death.\nControllable pets and decoys can still be commanded between realms.\nJungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not take presence between realms.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
