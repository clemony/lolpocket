This dash can cross terrain if the end point is beyond it. If she would end the dash inside terrain, she will instead look for a location  in either direction left or right that is outside of terrain and dash there. If there is no such location, she will dash only up to the wall at her normal speed, ending the dash early.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nThe shuriken missile will fire from wherever Akali is at the end of the cast time (usually mid-dash), but always towards and reaching the location that was 825 units in front of her at the start of cast. The only exception is if she moves via  Flash, in which case the range of the missile is decreased relative to the distance she blinked.\nKilling an enemy with the shuriken will still mark the last area of the  shroud hit.\nAttempting to cast  Five Point Strike during either dash will buffer it to cast as soon as the dash ends.\nThis ability's damage is calculated based on the caster's stats at the time of its application.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Twilight Shroud is usable.
