        "notes": "Caretaker's Shrine can be cast directly on an ally and it will be treated as a unit-targeted ability for effects such as  Guardian. This version also has a  forgiveness radius of 175 units.\nIf Bard has 3 shrines on the map and creates a new one that is cast directly on himself or an ally, the oldest shrine will not be destroyed. This is because the shrine is used as an actual targeted heal on himself or someone else, and not a permanent shrine, so the other 3 may stay.\nThe spell indicator of Caretaker's Shrine shows the area in which it can be used as a targeted heal. After a shrine has been placed on the ground its activation area becomes smaller: allies or enemies have to step directly on the shrine to use it or destroy it.\nLeveling up Caretaker's Shrine will update the healing of existing shrines.",
