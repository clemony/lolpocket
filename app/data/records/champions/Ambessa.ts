This causes the buffer to be cancelled and the dash to fail to trigger as a consequence.\nAttack commands will not be buffered to cast at the end of the lockout even while  grounded.\nIf multiple attack and movement commands are inputted during the lockout of an ability, the most recent one is used for the dash's targeting.\nIf the most recent input is not an attack or movement command, the dash will not trigger.\nIn this case, the buffer for the previous attack/movement command was cancelled by a new non-attack/movement command such as an input for an ability cast.\nDuring Drakehound's Step, a visual indicator is visible to Ambessa displaying the eventual dash's direction and destination location.\nThe number of available attacks empowered by Medarda Maxim are visible as pips under Ambessa's health bar, only visible to the player.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ambessa is  dashing:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nAll the other item-actives are usable\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Teleport  Recall\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
