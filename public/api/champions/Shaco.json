The target cannot be forced to move by the fear during the root.\nThe target is however allowed to move despite being rooted for the first 0.15 seconds of the root. They can be forced to move by the fear during this time.\nShaco and the Hallucination will face each other the moment of their appearance.\nThe explosion and the boxes apply  area damage, while the clone deals  pet damage.\nHallucinate will cast from wherever Shaco is at the end of the cast time.\nWhen Shaco dies, the clone will automatically target the closet visible enemy champion within 1500 units.\nThe clone will always spawn in the opposite direction of the cursor.\nIf Deceive and Hallucinate are used in quick succession, the clone will spawn in the direction of the cursor instead.",

Corrupted by dark magic and the loss of his beloved charge, the once-kind puppet finds pleasure only in the misery of the poor souls he torments. He uses toys and simple tricks to deadly effect, finding the results of his bloody “games” hilarious—and for those who hear a dark chuckle in the dead of night, the Demon Jester may have marked them as his next plaything.",
