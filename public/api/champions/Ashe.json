The entire effect is classified as a basic attack on a script-level, but is considered an ability for other effects (i.e  Sap Magic), which is likely due to a mistaken script-level tag.\nAlthough Ranger's Focus has no actual cooldown, 4 stacks of focus are needed before Ranger's Focus can be reactivated. The time before being able to reactivate Ranger's Focus is 6.08 : 1.6 (based on attack speed) seconds.\nEach arrow from a flurry applies  Frost and the bonus damage from  Frost Shot is calculated individually per arrow.\nSimilarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage,  Black Cleaver allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry.\nSources of flat damage reduction against any (physical) damage such as  Amumu's  Tantrum,  Leona's  Eclipse or  Fizz's  Nimble Fighter will apply the reduction to each arrow's damage, resulting in extremely reduced damaged compared to a normal attack.\nEach additional arrow from  Runaan's Hurricane will also split into 5 arrows.\nThe arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows.\nThe flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit, but no more than 3 targets per attack.\nThe flurry applies against structures.
