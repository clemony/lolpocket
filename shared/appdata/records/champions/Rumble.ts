The radius of each is 205 units, and rockets drop at a distance of 180 units between one another when The Equalizer is cast.\nThe missile that manages the rockets being deployed starts 150 units behind the target vector origin, and thus drops the first rocket at 30 units in front of the cast vector origin after 0.132 seconds.\nThe rockets are intended to not deal damage for the first 0.25 seconds. Due to a bug, this becomes 0.25-0.5 seconds 'at random'.\nIf Rumble dies while The Equalizer is just cast, this buff will be removed by death and the area of effect will start dealing damage sooner.(bug)",
