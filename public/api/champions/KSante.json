Conditioning,  Mountainous Vigor, etc) when reducing K'Sante's base resistances.(bug)\n Jak'Sho, The Protean's Voidborn Resilience specifically is taken into account.\nGaining bonus health during All Out causes the health threshold to be briefly increased then reset back to its original value.\nThe bonus health is still applied to his current health.\nDuring All Out's cast and displacement, the target's camera is locked and centered on their champion.\nFor K'Sante, his camera centers on him at the start of the cast time, then once again at the end of the cast time at the location of his blink behind the target, and it is not locked.\nAll Out's granted  untargetability from the  vanish during the target's pull of over 2000 units does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\nThe following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is in cast time:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is performing All Out's cast:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
