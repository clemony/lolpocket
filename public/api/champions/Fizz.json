Collision with  Mel's  Rebuttal will destroy it altogether, however.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nThe targeted area does not change unless the ability was cast beyond maximum range.\nIf the lure attaches to an enemy champion, a countdown will appear at their position to signify when the shark is about to emerge.
