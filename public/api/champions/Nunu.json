Due to flat bonuses increasing the time threshold, it is possible for the ability's effects to end before reaching the total uncapped movement speed.\nThe bonus movement speed ignores the movement speed cap.\nIf Nunu turns continuously he will create a 600 unit circle, increased with bonus movement speed, striking the same point up to 3 times, for a maximum of 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 300% AP) magic damage. The damage can be further increased by detonating the snowball, for a total of 360 / 450 / 540 / 630 / 720 (+450% AP) magic damage.\n Ryze's  Realm Warp will only teleport Nunu and Willump, leaving the  snowball behind.\nHovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of Biggest Snowball Ever!.\nNunu gains a slightly larger field of view during Biggest Snowball Ever!.\n Projectile-interception effects will destroy the snowball only after it has been released.\nBiggest Snowball Ever! is disabled for the first 15 seconds of the game.\n Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the  stun.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Nunu & Willump are  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed, but cannot input movement commands.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects",
