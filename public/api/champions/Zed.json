If he enters it while dashing, the dash is interrupted.\nIf the  dash is interrupted, Zed stops, places himself to the ground (ends all displacements affecting him, but does not remove  airborne effects), and reappears prematurely at his current location. The mark will still be applied regardless.\nZed will remove  airborne effects from himself immediately upon starting the dash.\nOnce Zed begins the  dash, two  Shadows will also appear to be dashing through his target, each one spawning a certain distance behind the target (from the right and left).
