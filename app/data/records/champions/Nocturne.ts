This feature is somewhat deprecated as it also limits chain-casting Duskbringer.\nDuskbringer\'s Dusk Trail will expose the path of affected units until its duration ends. It is a form of  obscured vision; the trail indirectly reveals the location of enemy units even in the fog of war, including those shrouded by  stealth.\n Spell shield will block the damage and also prevents the Dusk Trail from following the target.\nThe formed Dusk Trail does not disappear if Duskbringer is intercepted by  Wind Wall or  Unbreakable.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.\nThe bonus movement speed  stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts.',

  lore: 'A demonic amalgamation drawn from the nightmares that haunt every sentient mind, the thing known as Nocturne has become a primordial force of pure evil. It is liquidly chaotic in aspect, a faceless shadow with cold eyes and armed with wicked-looking blades. After freeing itself from the spirit realm, Nocturne descended upon the waking world, to feed upon the kind of terror that can only thrive in true darkness.',
