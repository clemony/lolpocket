damagePerMinute

timeCCingOthers/gameDuration


	•	damagePerMinute — better normalization than raw damage because it scales for game length.
	•	visionScorePerMinute — same reason as above; helps compare games of different durations.
	•	csPerMinute — derived from total CS and duration but is worth pre-calculating for scoring.
	•	timeCCingOthersPerMinute — CC impact normalized for time.
	•	damageSelfMitigated — important for tanks; shows how much damage you prevented from harming allies.
	•	teamDamagePercentage — shows share of total team damage.
	•	damageTakenOnTeamPercentage — you have this, but it’s big for tank MVP weight.
	•	turretPlatesTaken — big for early lane impact.

    	•	abilityUses and skillshotsHit — skill reliability (may need timeline parsing).
	•	epicMonsterSteals — stealing baron/dragon turns fights.
	•	multiKillCount — combined metric for all multikills.
	•	shutdowns — high-value kills that swing games.
	•	killsUnderOwnTurret — outplay stat.
	•	killsNearEnemyTurret — aggression indicator.
	•	comebackKills / killsAfterEnemyHasAdvantage — turning losing fights around.

Support & Utility-Specific
	•	healingOnOthers — separate from self-healing.
	•	shieldingOnOthers — you have totals, but breaking it out could let supports score higher when their damage is low.
	•	utilityScore — combined measure from Riot’s challenges for saveAllyFromDeath, peel stats, etc.
